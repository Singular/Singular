/*! \page resources_page This is a package that handled the system environment variables and especially the search path for Singular resources.
 *
 * Handles the system environment variables and especially 
 * the search path for Singular resources (like libraries and modules)
 * 
 * This may be used by factory in order to search for its precomputed
 * tables and thus have been separated into a standalone top-level package.
 * 
 * Note that this package has no further dependencies,
 * while it is used by the rest of Singular packages (\ref factory_page, \ref libpolys_page, \ref kernel_page, \ref singular_page).
