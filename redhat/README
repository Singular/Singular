=====================

To build Singular rpm packages run (with 4.0.0 replaced by the respective Singular version):
$ rpmbuild -tb singular-4.0.0.tar.gz

To install the newly created packages run (as superuser, with x86_64 replaced by your architecture and 4.0.0 by the respective Singular version):
$ cd `rpm --eval '%{_topdir}'`/RPMS
$ rpm -i x86_64/singular-4.0.0-1.x86_64.rpm noarch/singular-common-4.0.0-1.noarch.rpm
