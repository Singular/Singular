;;{{{ Style and coding conventions

;; Style and coding conventions:
;;
;; - "Singular" is written with an upper-case `S' in comments, doc
;;   strings, and messages.  As part of symbols, it is written with
;;   a lower-case `s'. 
;; - When referring to the Singular interactive mode, do it in that
;;   wording.  Use the notation `singular-interactive-mode' only when
;;   really referring to the lisp object.
;; - use a `fill-column' of 75 for doc strings and comments
;; - mark incomplete doc strings or code with `NOT READY' optionally
;;   followed by an explanation what exactly is missing
;;
;; - use foldings to structure the source code but try not to exceed a
;;   maximum depth of two foldings
;; - use lowercase folding titles except for first word
;; - folding-marks are `;;{{{' and `;;}}}' resp., for sake of standard
;;   conformity
;; - use the foldings to modularize code.  That is, each folding should be,
;;   as far as possible, self-content.  Define a function `singular-*-init'
;;   in the folding to do the initialization of the module contained in
;;   that folding.  Call that function from `singular-interactive-mode',
;;   for example, instead of initializing the module directly from
;;   `singular-interactive-mode'.  Look at the code how it is done for the
;;   simple section or for the folding stuff.
;;
;; - use `singular' as prefix for all global symbols
;; - use `singular-debug' as prefix for all global symbols concerning
;;   debugging.
;; - use, whenever possible without names becoming too clumsy, some unique
;;   prefix inside a folding
;;
;; - mark dependencies on Emacs flavor/version with a comment of the form
;;   `;; Emacs[ <version> ]'     resp.
;;   `;; XEmacs[ <version> ][ <nasty comment> ]'
;;   specified in that order, if possible
;; - use a `cond' statement to execute Emacs flavor/version-dependent code,
;;   not `if'.  This is to make such checks more extensible.
;; - try to define different functions for different flavors/version and
;;   use `singular-fset' at library-loading time to set the function you
;;   really need.  If the function is named `singular-<basename>', the
;;   flavor/version-dependent functions should be named
;;   `singular-<flavor>[-<version>]-<basename>'.
;;
;; - use `singular-debug' for debugging output/actions
;; - to switch between buffer and process names, use the functions
;;   `singular-process-name-to-buffer-name' and
;;   `singular-buffer-name-to-process-name'
;; - call the function `singular-keep-region-active' as last statement in
;;   an interactive function that should keep the region active (for
;;   example, in functions that move the point).  This is necessary to keep
;;   XEmacs' zmacs regions active.
;; - to get the process of the current buffer, use `singular-process'.  To
;;   get the current process mark, use `singular-process-mark'.  Both
;;   functions check whether Singular is alive and throw an error if not,
;;   so you do not have to care about that yourself.  If you do not want an
;;   error specify non-nil argument NO-ERROR.  But use them anyway.
;; - we assume that the buffer is *not* read-only
;; - use `=' instead of `eq' when comparing buffer locations.  Even if you
;;   are sure that both operands are integers.

;;{{{ Customizing

;; Note:
;;
;; Some notes on Customize:
;;
;; - The documentation states that for the `:initialize' option of
;;   `defcustom' the default value is `custom-initialize-set'.  However, in
;;   the source code of Customize `custom-initialize-reset' is used.  So
;;   better always specify the `:initialize' option explicitly.
;; - Customize is bad at setting buffer-local variables or properties.
;;   This is quite natural since Customize itself uses its own buffer.  So
;;   changing buffer-local variables and properties with Customize is
;;   possible only at a "Singular-global" level.  That is, for all buffers
;;   currently having Singular interactive mode as major mode.  The function
;;   `singular-map-buffer' helps to do such customization.
;; - Important note: Customizable variables are not automatically marked as
;;   user options.  This has to be done as usual by marking them with a '*'
;;   as first character of the documentation string.  Without that, the
;;   variables are not accessible to, for example, `set-variable'.
;;
;; Some common customizing patterns:
;;
;; - How to customize buffer-local properties?
;;   First, the `defcustom' itself must not set anything buffer-local since
;;   at time of its definition (most likely) no Singular buffers will be
;;   around.  If there are Singular buffers we do not care about them.  But
;;   anyhow, at definition of the `defcustom' the global default has to be
;;   set.  Hence, the `:initialize' option should be set to
;;   `custom-initialize-default'.
;;   The buffer-local initialization has to be done at mode initialization
;;   time.  The global default value should then be used to set the local
;;   properties.
;;   At last, the function specified with the `:set' option should set the
;;   local properties in all Singular buffers to the new, customized value.
;;   Most likely, the function `singular-map-buffer' may be used for that.
;;   In addition, the function should, of course, set the global value via
;;   `set-default'.
;;   For an example, see `singular-folding-line-move-ignore-folding'.
;;
;; - How to encapsulate other mode's global variables into Singular
;;   interactive mode variables?
;;   Set them always.  That is, set them if the `defcustom' is evaluated
;;   (use `custom-initialize-reset' as `:initial' function) and set them
;;   when the Singular interactive mode variable is customized (by means
;;   of an appropriate `:set' function).
;;   For an example, see `singular-section-face-alist' (which does not
;;   encapsulate another mode's variable, but Singular interactive mode's
;;   own variable `singular-simple-sec-clear-type').

;;{{{ Comint

;; Note:
;;
;; We require Comint, but we really do not use it too much.  One may argue
;; that this is bad since Comint is a standardized way to communicate with
;; external processes.  One may argue further that many experienced Emacs
;; users are forced now to re-do their Comint customization for Singular
;; interactive mode.  However, we believe that the intersection between
;; experienced Emacs users and users of Singular interactive mode is almost
;; empty.
;;
;; In fact, we used Comint really much in the beginning of this project.
;; Later during development it turned at that using Comint's input and
;; output processing is to inflexible and not appropriate for Singular
;; interactive mode with its input and output sections.  So we begun to
;; rewrite large portions of Comint to adapt it to our needs.  At some
;; point it came clear that it would be best to throw out Comint
;; alltogether, would not have been there some auxilliary functions which
;; are really useful but annoying to rewrite.  These are, for example, the
;; command line history functions or the completion stuff offered by
;; Comint.
;;
;; Our policy with regard to these remainders of Comint is: Use the
;; functions to bind them to keys, but do not use them internally.
;; Encapsulate Comint customization into Singular interactive mode
;; customization.  In particular, do not take care about Comint settings
;; which already may be present, overwrite them.  Hide Comint from the
;; user.
;;
;; Here is how exactly we use Comint:
;;
;; - All variables necessary to use Comint's input ring are properly
;;   initialized.  One may find this in the `History' folding.
;; - `comint-prompt-regexp' is initialized since it is used in some
;;   of the functions regarding input ring handling.  Furthermore, its
;;   initialization enables us to use functions as `comint-bol', etc.
;;   Initialization is done in the `Skipping and stripping prompts ...'
;;   folding.
;; - We call `comint-mode' as first step in `singular-interactive-mode'.
;;   Most of the work done there is to initialize the local variables as
;;   necessary.  Besides that, the function does nothing that interferes
;;   with Singular interactive mode.  To be consequent we set
;;   `comint-mode-hook' temporarily to nil when calling `comint-mode'.
;; - In `singular-exec', we use `comint-exec-1' to fire up the process.
;;   Furthermore, we set `comint-ptyp' there as it is used in the signal
;;   sending commands of Comint.  All that `comint-exec-1' does is that it
;;   sets up the process environment (it adds or modifies the setting of
;;   the 'TERM' variable), sets the execution directory, and does some
;;   magic with the process coding stuff.
;; - One more time the most important point: we do *not* use Comint's
;;   output and input processing.  In particular, we do not run any of
;;   Comint's hooks on input or output.  Anyway, we do better, don't we?

;;{{{ Simple section API for both Emacs and XEmacs

;; Note:
;;
;; Sections and simple sections are used to mark Singular's input and
;; output for further access.  Here are some general notes on simple
;; sections.  Sections are explained in the respective folding.
;;
;; In general, simple sections are more or less Emacs' overlays or XEmacs
;; extents, resp.  But they are more than simply an interface to overlays
;; or extents.
;;
;; - Simple sections are non-empty portions of text.  They are interpreted
;;   as left-closed, right-opened intervals, i.e., the start point of a
;;   simple sections belongs to it whereas the end point does not.
;; - Simple sections start and end at line borders only.
;; - Simple sections do not overlap.  Thus, any point in the buffer may be
;;   covered by at most one simple section.
;; - Besides from their start and their end, simple sections have some type
;;   associated. 
;; - Simple sections are realized using overlays (extents for XEmacs)
;;   which define the start and, end, and type (via properties) of the
;;   simple section.  Actually, as a lisp object a simple section is
;;   nothing else but the underlying overlay.
;; - There may be so-called clear simple sections.  Clear simple sections
;;   have not an underlying overlay.  Instead, they start at the end of the
;;   preceding non-clear simple section, end at the beginning of the next
;;   non-clear simple section, and have the type defined by
;;   `singular-simple-sec-clear-type'.  Clear simple sections are
;;   represented by nil.
;; - Buffer narrowing does not restrict the extent of completely or
;;   partially inaccessible simple sections.  But one should note that
;;   some of the functions assume that there is no narrowing in
;;   effect.
;; - After creation, simple sections are not modified any further.
;; - There is one nasty little corner case: what if a non-clear simple
;;   section spans up to end of buffer?  By definition, eob is not included

;;{{{ Section API

;; Note:
;;
;; Sections are built on simple sections.  Their purpose is to cover the
;; difference between clear and non-clear simple sections.
;;
;; - Sections consist of a simple section, its type, and its start and end
;;   points.  This is redundant information only in the case of non-clear
;;   simple section.
;; - Sections are read-only objects, neither are they modified nor are they
;;   created.
;; - Buffer narrowing does not restrict the extent of completely or
;;   partially inaccessible sections.  In contrast to simple sections the
;;   functions concerning sections do not assume that there is no narrowing
;;   in effect.  However, most functions provide an optional argument
;;   RESTRICTED that restricts the start and end point of the returned
;;   sections to the currently active restrictions.  Of course, that does
;;   not affect the range of the underlying simple sections, only the
;;   additional start and end points being returned.  One should note that
;;   by restricting sections one may get empty sections, that is, sections
;;   for which the additional start and end point are equal.
;; - In many cases it is not desirable that the user operates on sections
;;   which are not completely accessible.  To check that a section is
;;   completely accessible the `singular-section-check' function should be
;;   used.
;; - Sections are independent from implementation dependencies.  There are
;;   no different versions of the functions for Emacs and XEmacs.
;; - Whenever possible, one should not access simple section directly.
;;   Instead, one should use the section API.

  "*Alist that maps section types to faces.
Should be a list consisting of elements (SECTION-TYPE . FACE-OR-NIL), where
SECTION-TYPE is either `input' or `output'.

At any time, the Singular interactive mode buffer is completely covered by
sections of two different types: input sections and output sections.  This
variable determines which faces are used to display the different sections.

If for type SECTION-TYPE the value FACE-OR-NIL is a face it is used to
display the contents of all sections of that particular type.
If instead FACE-OR-NIL equals nil sections of that type become so-called
clear sections.  The content of clear sections is displayed as regular
text, with no faces at all attached to them.

;;   (using the time stamp set by `singular-help-pre-input-filter') whether
;;   the user issued a help command at most one second ago.  If so,
;;   `singular-help-pre-output-filter' starts checking Singular's output
;;   for the response on the help command.  If it finds one it remembers
;;   the help topic in `singular-help-topic' and removes the response from
;;   Singular's output.
;;   There is some extra magic built into the filter to handle responses
;;   from Singular which are received by emacs not in one string but in
;;   more than one piece (we call that pending output).
;; - As the last step step of this procedure, `singular-post-output-filter'
;;   fires up an Info buffer using `singular-help' if the variable
;;   `singular-help-topic' is non-nil.  This step is separated from the
;;   previous one since joining both leads to some trouble in point
;;   management.  This is mainly due to the fact that `singular-help' opens
;;   a new window.
;;
;; To show some online help, the online help manual has to be available, of
;; course.  There is a number of possibilites for the user to set the file
;; name of the manual explicitly, as described in the documentation string
;; to `singular-help'.  But in general the file name should be recognized
;; automatically by Singular interactive mode.  For that to work, Singular
;; prints the file name when it comes up and option `--emacs' is specified.
;; This is recognized by `singular-scan-header-pre-output-filter' which
;; sets the variable `singular-help-file-name' accordingly.  For more
;; information one should refer to the `Header scanning ...' folding.
;;
;; Another variable which needs to be set for proper operation is
;; `singular-help-topics-alist' for completion of help topics and for
;; recognition of help topics around point.  It is no error for this
;; variable not to be set: simply the features do not work then.

;; this `require' is necessary since we use functions from the Info package
;; which are not declared as `autoload'

  "Load demo file DEMO-FILE and enter Singular demo mode.

The Singular demo mode allows to step conveniently through a prepared demo
file.  The contents of the demo file is made visible and executed in
portions called chunks.  How the chunks have to be marked in the demo file
is described below.

After loading the demo file with this function, \\[singular-send-or-copy-input] displays the first
chunk of the demo file at the Singular prompt.  This chunk may be modified
\(or even deleted) and then sent to Singular entering \\[singular-send-or-copy-input] as any command
would have been sent to Singular.  The next time \\[singular-send-or-copy-input] is entered, the next
chunk of the demo file is displayed, and so on.

One may interrupt this sequence and enter commands at the Singular input
prompt as usual.  As soon as \\[singular-send-or-copy-input] is entered directly after the input
prompt, the next chunk of the demo file is displayed.  Here is the exact
algorithm how this magic works: If point is located at the very end of the
buffer *and* immediately after Singular's last input prompt, the next chunk
of the demo file is displayed.  In particular, if there is any text after
the last input prompt that text is sent to Singular as usual and no new
chunks are displayed.

After displaying the last chunk of DEMO-FILE, Singular demo mode
automatically terminates and normal operation is resumed.  To prematurely
exit Singular demo mode \\[singular-demo-exit] may be used.

DEMO-FILE should consist of regular Singular commands.  Portions of text
separated by a blank line are taken to be the chunks of the demo file.

There is a number of variables to configure Singular demo mode.  Refer to
the `singular-demo-mode' customization group for more information.

Important note: The unprocessed contents of DEMO-FILE is hidden using
buffer narrowing.  Emacs gets terribly confused when during demo mode the
buffer is either narrowed to some other region or if the buffer is widened.
The safest thing to do if that happens by accident is to explicitly exit
the demo by means of \\[singular-demo-exit] and to try to resume somehow
normal operation.

`singular-demo-load' runs the functions on `singular-demo-mode-enter-hook'
just after demo mode has been entered.  The functions on
`singular-demo-mode-exit-hook' are executed after Singular demo mode has
been exited, either prematurely or due to the end of the demo file.
However, it its important to note that in the latter case the last chunk of
the demo file is still waiting to be sent to Singular."

For \"backward compatibility\" with the terminal version of Singular there
is some extra magic built into Singular interactive mode which catches help
commands issued at the command prompt and executes this function instead.
However, this magic is really not too magic and easily may be fooled.  If
this magic if fooled Singular prints some error message starting like this:

// ** Your help command could not be executed. ...

However, the most common case should be recognized: If one issues a help
command to a non-busy Singular, where the help command comes on one line
and is properly terminated with a semicolon.  Like that:

help ring;

`singular-interactive-mode-hook'.
