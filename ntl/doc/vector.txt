MODULE: vector

SUMMARY:

Macros are defined providing template-like classes for dynamic-sized
arrays.

The macro NTL_vector_decl(T,vec_T) declares a class vec_T, whose
implementation can be instantiated with NTL_vector_impl(T,vec_T).  It is
presumed that the underlying type have a public default constructor, copy
constructor, assignment operator, and a destructor (this is
normally the case for most types).

Note that the type T must be a type name (you'll need to make
a typedef for the type if this is not the case).

If the type T supports I/O operator << and >>, then vec_T can be
made to support these operators as well using NTL_io_vector_decl(T,vec_T) and
NTL_io_vector_impl(T,vec_T).

The same goes for equality operators == and != using 
NTL_eq_vector_decl(T,vec_T) and NTL_eq_vector_impl(T,vec_T).

The declaration

   vec_T v;

creates a zero-length vector.  To grow this vector to length n,
execute

   v.SetLength(n)

This causes space to be allocated for (at least) n elements, and also
causes the delault constructor for T to be called to initialize these
elements.

The current length of a vector is available as v.length().

The i-th vector element (counting from 0) is accessed as v[i].  If the
macro NTL_RANGE_CHECK is defined, code is emitted to test if 0 <= i <
v.length().  This check is not performed by default.

For old-time FORTRAN programmers, the i-th vector element (counting
from 1) is accessed as v(i).

Let n = v.length().  Calling v.SetLength(m) with m <= n sets the
current length of v to m (but does not call any destructors or free
any space).  Calling v.SetLength(m) with m > n will allocate space and
initialize as necessary, but will leave the values of the already
allocated elements unchanged (although their addresses may change).
Initializations are performed using T's default constructor.

v.MaxLength() is the largest value of n for which v.SetLength(n) was invoked,
and is equal to the number of entries that have been initialized.
v.SetMaxLength(n) will allocate space for and
initialize up to n elements, without changing v.length().

When v's destructor is called, all constructed elements will be
destructed, and all space will be relinquished.

Space is managed using malloc, realloc, and free.  When a vector is
grown, a bit more space may be allocated than was requested for
efficiency reasons.

Note that when a vector is grown, the space is reallocated using
realloc, and thus the addresses of vector elements may change,
possibly creating dangling references to vector elements.  One has to
be especially careful of this when using vectors passed as reference
parameters that may alias one another.

Because realloc is used to grow a vector, the objects stored
in a vector should be "relocatable"---that is, they shouldn't care
what their actual address is, which may change over time.
Most reasonable objects satisfy this constraint.

v.allocated() is the number of elements which have been allocated,
which may be more than the number elements initialized.
Note that if n <= v.allocated(), then v.SetLength(n) is guaranteed
not to cause any memory allocation, or movement of objects.

                  Customized Constructors and Destructors
 
Esoteric: skip on first reading

When new elements in a vector need to be constructed, the routine

   void BlockConstruct(T* p, long n);

is called, whose default implementation invokes the default
constructor for T n times.  Likewise, when a vector is destroyed, the
routine

   void BlockDestroy(T* p, long n);

is called, whose default implementation invokes the default destructor
for T n times.

Both of these default implementations can be overridden as follows.
Instead of implementing vec_T with NTL_vector_impl(T,vec_T), implement it
with NTL_vector_impl_plain(T,vec_T), and then write your own BlockConstruct and
BlockDestroy.

For an example of this, see vec_ZZ_p.c.
