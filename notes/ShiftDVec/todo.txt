TODO List - Letterplace DVec Implementation

[PP]   - very high priority
[P]    -      high priority
[p]    -           priority
other  -  no/minor priority
[?]    -   unknown priority

· [PP] Die aktuellste Version dieser Liste soll von nun an in Git
  gespeichert werden.

· [PP] Update this list.

· [?] Complete the TODO-List
  Status: don't know
  Note: There is always something I forget

· Complete files.txt and remove unecessary files from git. (e.g
  some files from Singular/gdb; replace freegb_wrkcp.lib with
  stable version.)

· [P] Get the inhomogenous case to work (basically):
  Status: seems to work, testing needed
  Notes: Only a few calculations were made, especially very few
  inhomogenous GB were calculated - we may still be in for
  surprises
  
· [P] Get other orderings than dp to work:
  Status: shouldn't be to hard but: see Notes
  Note1: for weighted orderings we have first to change the
  monomial structure - see „Implementational Details“ subitem
  „Changes to monomial structure“
  Note2: Which ordering is good for us has to be cleared by
  Viktor/Grischa, I will assume, that every ordering is
  multiplicative. However: There were some special orderings
  Viktor and Grischa were talking about, which I think were
  considered to solve the rp-Problem (see „Theory“ below). These
  orderings Viktor wanted me to implement once (I think). That
  could result in lots of work and I have to think about, how to
  implement that effictiently. For sure, some of the comparison
  algorithms in Singular have to be adapted.

· Do we need the „Noether“-Versions of the multiplications?
  Status: nothing done so far
  Note: What are these Versions good for anyway?

· [P/p] Buckets
  Status: nothing done so far
  Note: I don't know, if that is a problem. I have to investigate
  it a bit more thoroughly. Viktor wanted me to include it, since
  it could improve the performance of our algorithm. I do not
  really know, what priority this has.

· [p] GB over Left-/Right-Ideals
  Status: nothing done so far
  Notes: Viktor wants us to do that
  
· [P] Testing, comparison of output:
  Status: To be done
  Note: Testing and debugging are always necessary..., well for
  the latter: Never had luck with it...

· Implementational Details:
  Status: Will be always incomplete
  - [PP] Do not use shifting anylonger:
    Status: incomplete
    Notes: This is an important one, I think. Code will get
    cleaner and software more efficient, should have priority
  - [p] Search for memory leaks
    Status: unknown - may always be incomplete/unknown
    Notes: There are some portions of singular, especially in our
    part of the implementation, i suspect to have memory leaks.
    I suspect especially the SPoly functions and the ksReduce
    functions:
    Do we free the cofactors correctly?
    Do we free the (l)ms which are cancelled?
  - Why does the invokation of
    r->p_Procs->p_Minus_mm_Mult_qq in pInline2.h:582
    with the additional last parameter "last" work? The Pointer
    declared in p_Procs.h:29 does not have this parameter!
  - [P] changes to monomial structure
    Status: to be done
    Explanation: We want to have an additional field, which tells
    us, how long our polynomial is (how many exponents there are,
    noequal to zero). (Viktor named it length, but it is just a
    non-weighted Totaldegre - hence the length of the
    corresponding DVec.) For orderings, which set weight=1 to all
    variables, this is no problem, since the weighted Totaldegree
    is already stored, but for other weight settings... I think
    Grischa claimed, that the non-weighted Totaldegree is stored,
    but Hans S. disagreed - maybe the non-weighted Td is just
    emitted at the interface, when one examines the poly...
    however, we have to find that out. An additional field for
    the shift might rather not be handy, since we want to map
    several shifts to one poly, but one can think about that, as
    a temporary field, but I dont think it will be useful. Shifts
    have to be stored in the T-/LObjects. All this is important
    for the multiplication, thus the reduction, creation of
    s-polys, etc. and for orderings (see above:
    „Get other orderings than dp to work“). We have to look into
    rComplete for how to change the structure of the monomials. I
    think that could be difficult, though Hannes or Viktor would
    disagree, I am sure. 
    Note to myself: see also:
    /home/ben/data/scripts/src/singular/00_notes

· [p] make implementation ready to be included in next release
  Status: to be done
  - clean the code:
    Status: gets worse every day
    Notes: maybe that should have higher priority, but somewhere
    we have to shorten our demands...
  - write a documentation
    a) of the interface
    Status: to be done
    Notes: Have to include some concise but meaningful examples
    b) of the theory
    Status: I think Grischa wrote about Gebauer Möller...

· [P] Profiling of our Implementation
  Status: to be done
  Notes: Which parts of the code result in the highest cpu-usage?
  Note to myself: See 
  /home/ben/data/scripts/src/singular/00_notes
  for some approaches

· [p] merge /home/ben/data/scripts/src/singular/00_notes hereto
  Status: to be done
  Notes: overview, what i have written

· [P] Theory
  Status: ask Grischa
  Notes: Orderings, Gebauer Möller, etc.
  (reverse) lexicographical ordering not multiplicative
  let x > y, reverse lexicographical, then:
  y^2 > y, but x*y^2 < x*y - epic fail ...
  Question to myself: Is it really good to translate the
  commutative rp to the non-commutative ordering like that, are
  there no other choices...? Obviously you can't just literally
  translate the ordering, because otherwise you would have that
  yx == xy (or non comparable...). But for those cases one could
  take the non-commutative interpretation (thus yx < xy) and for
  the others the commutative (thus x*y^2 > x*y) or some other
  mixture... But ok, the theoretical stuff is considered by
  Grischa and Viktor.
  Note to myself: Have to read more about orderings and their
  matrices. Viktor gave me a short introduction for free, but it
  was very fast and I didn't take notes
