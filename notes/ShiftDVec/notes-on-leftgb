Calculating Left Ideals in Factor Algebras

· only obstructions (1, p_I, r; l, p_J, 1)
  (p_I from I, p_J from J)
· Cases for Gebauer Moeller:

  1st Case:
  p_i p_j p'i with p_i p'i from I;
  both building new pairs with p_j
  iiiiii    p_i
     jjjjjj p_j
   IIII     p'i

  2nd Case:
  p_i p_j p'i with p_i p'i from I;
  p_i p_j building a new pair
  lm(p_j) lm(p'i) leading monoms from a pair in L
  iiiiii    p_i
     jjjjjj p_j
   IIII     p'i

  3rd Case: (cancelling of pair from L)
  p_i p_j p'i with p_i p'i from I;
  p_i p_j building a new pair
  lm(p_j) lm(p'i) leading monoms from a pair in L
  IIIII     p'i
     jjjjjj p_j
   iiiii    p_i

Idea (not implemented):
· Init: S := J
· For every p_s in S we keep a list of references to the P_l in
  L. A reference is given if and only if p_s is the shifted
  polynomial in the pair P_l.
