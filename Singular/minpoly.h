 * Implementation of an algorithm to compute the minimal polynomial of a           *
 * square matrix A \in \F_p^{n \times n}.                                          *
 *                                                                                 *
 * Let V_1, \dotsc, V_k \in \F_p^{1 \times n} be vectors such that                 *
 * V_1, V_1*A, V_1*A^2, \dotsc, V_2, V_2*A, V_2*A^2, \dotsc                        *
 * generate \F_p^{1 \times n}.                                                     *
 * Let mpV_i be the monic polynomial of smallest degree such that                  *
 * V_i*mpV_i(A) = 0.                                                               *
 * Then the minimal polynomial of A is the least common multiple of the mpV_i.     *
 *                                                                                 *
 *                                                                                 *
 * The algorithm uses two classes:                                                 *
 *                                                                                 *
 * 1. LinearDependencyMatrix                                                       *
 * This is used to find a linear dependency between the vectors V, V*A, \ldotsc.   *
 * To to this, it has an internal n \times (2n + 1) matrix.                        *
 * Every time a new row VA^i is inserted, it is reduced via Gauss' Algorithm,      *
 * using right hand sides. If VA^i is reduced to zero, then the vectors are        *
 * linearly dependend, and the dependency can be read of at the right hand sides.  *
 *                                                                                 *
 * Example: Compute the minimal polynomial of A = [[0,1],[1,1]] with V = [1,0]     *
 * over F_5.                                                                       *
 * Then LinearDependencyMatrix will be:                                            *
 * After the first step (i.e., after inserting V = [1,0]):                         *
 *       ( 1 0 | 1 0 0 )                                                           *
 * After the second step (i.e., after inserting VA = [0,1]):                       *
 *       ( 1 0 | 1 0 0 )                                                           *
 *       ( 0 1 | 0 1 0 )                                                           *
 * In the third step, where VA^2 = [1,1] is inserted, the row                      *
 *       ( 1 1 | 0 0 1 )                                                           *
 * is reduced to                                                                   *
 *       ( 0 0 | 4 4 1)                                                            *
 * Thus VA^2 + 4*VA + 4*V = 0, so mpV = t^2 + 4*t + 4.                             *
 *                                                                                 *
 *                                                                                 *
 *                                                                                 *
 * 2. NewVectorMatrix                                                              *
 * If one vector V_1 is not enough to compute the minimal polynomial, i.e. the     *
 * vectors V_1, V_1*A, V_1*A^2, \dotsc don't generate \F_p^{1 \times n}, then      *
 * we have to find a vector V_2 which is not in the span of the V_1*A^i.           *
 * This is done with NewVectorMatrix, which simply holds a reduced n \times n      *
 * matrix, where the rows generate the span of the V_jA^i.                         *
 * To find a vector which is not in the span, simply take the k-th standard        *
 * vector, where k is not a pivot element of A.                                    *
 *                                                                                 *
 *                                                                                 *
 * For efficiency reasons, the matrix entries in LinearDependencyMatrix            *
 * and NewVectorMatrix are not initialized to zero. Instead, a variable rows       *
 * is used to indicate the number of rows which are nonzero (all further           *
 * rows are regarded as zero rows). Furthermore, the array pivots stores the       *
 * pivot entries of the rows, i.e., pivots[i] indicates the position of the        *
 * first non-zero entry in the i-th row, which is normalized to 1.                 *
