 *
 * ABSTRACT: This file provides the following miscellaneous functionality:
 *           - prime factorisation of bigints with prime factors < 2^31
 *            (This will require at most 256 MByte of RAM.)
 *           - approximate square root of a bigint
 *
 *           Most of the functioanlity implemented here had earlier been
 *           coded in SINGULAR in some library. Due to performance reasons
 *           these algorithms have been moved to the C/C++ kernel.

/**
 * Factorises a given bigint number n into its prime factors less
 * than or equal to a given bound, with corresponding multiplicities.
 *
 * The method finds all prime factors with multiplicities. If a positive
 * bound is given, then only the prime factors <= pBound are being found.
 * In this case, there may remain an unfactored portion m of n.
 * Also, when n is negative, m will contain the sign. If n is zero, m will
 * be zero.
 * The method returns a list L filled with four entries:
 * L[1] a list; L[1][i] contains the i-th prime factor of |n| as int or
 *                      bigint (sorted in ascending order),
 * L[2] a list; L[2][i] contains the multiplicity of L[1, i] in |n| as int
 * L[3] contains the remainder m as int or bigint, depending on the size,
 * L[4] 1 iff |m| is probably a prime, 0 otherwise
 *
 * We thus have: n = L[1][1]^L[2][1] * ... * L[1][k]^L[2][k] * L[1], where
 * k is the number of mutually distinct prime factors (<= a provided non-
 * zero bound).
 * Note that for n = 0, L[2] and L[3] will be emtpy lists and L[4] will be
 * zero.
