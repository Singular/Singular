/*! \page factory_page Multivariate polynomial factorization (factory)

 Factory is a C++ class library that implements a recursive representation
 of multivariate polynomial data.

 Factory handles sparse multivariate polynomials over different
 coefficient domains, such as Z, Q and GF(q), as well as algebraic
 extensions over Q and GF(q) in an efficient way.  Factory includes
 algorithms for computing univariate and multivariate gcds, resultants,
 chinese remainders, algorithms to factorize multivariate polynomials,
 univariate polynomials over alg. function fields, and to compute the
 absolute factorization of multivariate polynomials with integer coefficients.

 The interface to the polynomial system of Factory is provided by a single
 class `\ref CanonicalForm' which can deal with elements of the coefficient
 domain as well as polynomials.
