/*! \page factory_page Factory
 *
 * Factory is a C++ class library that implements a recursive representation
 * of multivariate polynomial data.
 *
 * Factory handles sparse multivariate polynomials over different
 * coefficient domains, such as Z, Q and GF(q), as well as algebraic
 * extensions over Q and GF(q) in an efficient way.  Factory includes
 * algorithms for computing univariate and multivariate gcds, resultants,
 * chinese remainders, algorithms to factorize multivariate polynomials,
 * univariate polynomials over alg. function fields, and to compute the
 * absolute factorization of multivariate polynomials with integer coefficients.
 *
 * The interface to the polynomial system of Factory is provided by a single
 * class `CanonicalForm' which can deal with elements of the coefficient
 * domain as well as polynomials.
 *
 * \note For more information on how to configure, install and add new code to
 * factory, see README.
