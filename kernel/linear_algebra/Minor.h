/*! \class MinorKey
    \brief Class MinorKey can be used for representing keys in a cache for
    sub-determinantes; see class Cache.

    As such, it is a realization of the template class KeyClass which is used
    in the declaration of class Cache. Following the documentation of class
    Cache, we need to implement at least the methods:<br>
    <c>bool MinorKey::operator< (const MinorKey& key),</c><br>
    <c>bool MinorKey::operator== (const MinorKey& key),</c><br>
    MinorKey uses two private arrays of ints \c _rowKey and \c _columnKey to
    encode rows and columns of a pre-defined matrix. Semantically, the row
    indices and column indices form the key for caching the value of the
    corresponding minor.<br>
    More concretely, let us assume that the pre-defined matrix has
    <em>32*R+r, r<32,</em> rows and <em>32*C+c, c<32,</em> columns. All row
    indices can then be captured using R+1 ints, since an int is a
    32-bit-number (regardless of the platform). The analog holds for the
    columns. Consequently, each instance of MinorKey encodes the sets of rows
    and columns which shall belong to the minor of interest (and which shall
    not).<br>
    Example: The \c _rowKey with \c _rowKey[1] = 0...011 and
    \c _rowKey[0] = 0...01101 encodes the rows with indices 33, 32, 3, 2,
    and 0.
