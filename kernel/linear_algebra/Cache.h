/*! \class Cache
    \brief Class Cache is a template-implementation of a cache with
    arbitrary classes for representing keys and values, respectively.

    Each entry of the cache is of the form <em>key --> value</em>,
    where \e key is an instance of some \c KeyClass, and \e value
    an instance of some \c ValueClass.<br><br>
    This implementation comes with the possibility to define bounds
    on both the number of cached pairs <em>key --> value</em> and on
    the total \e weight of the cache.<br>
    Here, the \e weight of a cache is defined as the sum
    of \e weights of all cached values, where the \e weight of each value
    needs to be implemented in the actual class \c ValueClass.
    An example for the weight of a cached value
    may simply be its size in bytes, or may capture some other useful notion
    of how \e heavy the value is. E.g., when caching polynomials, the \e weight
    may be defined to be equal to the number of its monomials.<br><br>
    The <em>key --> value</em> pairs of a cache are being stored in two
    standard lists \c _key and \c _value of equal length <em>L</em>.<br>
    In order to enable a fast
    value lookup, the vector \c _key maintains an ordering such that<br>
    <em> i < j  ==>  _key[i] < _key[j],</em><br>
    where the right-hand side comparator
    \e < needs to be implemented by class \c KeyClass. Note that this
    ordering allows for value lookup in time <em>O(log(L))</em>, when given
    a specific key.<br><br>
    In addition to \c _key and \c _value, there is a third book-keeping
    structure in Cache: The vector \c _rank of integers captures ranking
    information among all cached values. More concretely,<br>
    <em>_rank : {0, 1, 2, ..., L - 1} --> {0, 1, 2, ..., L - 1}</em><br>
    is a bijection with the semantic<br>
    <em>_rank[s] < _rank[t] :<==> _value[_rank[s]] < _value[_rank[t]],</em><br>
    where the right-hand side comparator \e < needs to be
    implemented by class \c ValueClass. The intention here is that any relation
    <em>_rank[s] < _rank[t]</em>
    is to imply that the key-value pair
    <em>_key[_rank[t]] --> _value[_rank[t]]</em> will be kept at least as
    long in cache as <em> _key[_rank[s]] --> _value[_rank[s]]</em>.
    (I.e., loosely speaking, the higher the rank, the longer a pair is going
    to be cached.)<br><br>
    Whenever the cache becomes either too large (in terms of number of
    entries), or too \e heavy (in terms of accumulated weight), it will
    automatically shrink until both bounds will have been re-established. To
    this end, the <em>key --> value</em> pair with least value rank will be
    erased from the cache. This process is repeated until the cache is small
    enough again, in terms of both the number of entries and the \e weight.
    (Note that it may be necessary to erase numerous pairs after inserting
    just one <em>key --> value</em> when this value's \e weight is
    unproportionally high.)<br><br>
    In order to make the above procedures work, the two template classes
    \c KeyClass and \c ValueClass need to implement the following methods:<br>
    <c>bool KeyClass::operator< (const KeyClass& key),</c><br>
    <c>bool KeyClass::operator== (const KeyClass& key),</c><br>
    <c>bool ValueClass::operator< (const ValueClass& key),</c><br>
    <c>bool ValueClass::operator== (const ValueClass& key),</c><br>
    <c>int ValueClass::getWeight ().</c>
