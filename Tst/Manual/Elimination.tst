  // 1. Compute equations of curve given in parametric form:
  // Two transversal cusps in (k^3,0):
  ring r1 = 0,(t,x,y,z),ls;
  ideal i1 = x-t2,y-t3,z;        // parametrization of the first branch

  // 3. Compute the tangent developable
  // The tangent developable of a projective variety given parametrically
  // by F=(f1,...,fn) : P^r --> P^n is the union of all tangent spaces
  // of the image. The tangent space at a smooth point F(t1,...,tr)

  // the tangent map (affine coordinates)
  //   T(t1,...,tr): (y1,...,yr) --> jacob(f)*transpose((y1,...,yr))
  // where jacob(f) denotes the jacobian matrix of f with respect to the
  // t's evaluated at the point (t1,...,tr).
  // Hence we have to create the graph of this map and then to eliminate
  // the t's and y's.
  // The rational normal curve in P^4 is given as the image of
  //        F(s,t) = (s4,s3t,s2t2,st3,t4)
  // each component being homogeneous of degree 4.

                         // and adds (concatenates) two ideals

  // for the variables a,...,e.
