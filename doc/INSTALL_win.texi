@heading For the impatient:
@itemize
@item
If you run Windows NT/2000, make sure you are logged in with the
@code{Administrator} rights.
@item
If you have @code{Cygwin} or @code{XEmacs} installed, please read the information below.
@item
Execute the self-extracting installation archive and
@strong{carefully} follow the instructions given there.
Setup will analyze your system, create the corresponding configuration
and give you further tips on the installation process.

In case of troubles, see the installed file @code{/etc/INSTALL} or visit

@heading Installation preliminaries

To run @sc{Singular} on MS Windows requires that the Cygwin DLL
(dynamically linked library) version 1.1.8 or higher is installed on your
system (see @uref{http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/} for details about
Cygwin). We install and configure Cygwin version 1.1.8 automatically, if
the @code{BasicCygwin} component is selected.

To run @sc{ESingular} (i.e. @sc{Singular} within its Emacs interface) on
MS Windows requires furthermore that the XEmacs editor is installed on
your system.

@cindex Windows installation, components
@cindex Components of Windows installation

Therefore, the @sc{Singular} installation is divided into the following
components:
@table @code
@item @strong{Program Files:}
        @table @code
@item Singular-@value{VERSION}
Contains the @sc{Singular} Program, Documentation And Example Files.
@*All files of this component are installed under the directory
@code{/usr/local/Singular/@value{VERSION}}
@item BasicCygwin
Contains the Cygwin DLL and basic tools/programs (like @code{bash} or
@code{info}) of the  Cygwin environment.
@*The Cygwin DLL and programs are installed in the directory
@code{/bin}. Miscellaneous documentation and configuration files are
installed into the directory @code{/etc}.
@item XEmacs
Contains the Cygwin port of the XEmacs editor (see
@url{http://www.xemacs.org} for more about XEmacs) version 21.1.12.
@*All files of this component are installed under the directory
@code{/usr/local}.
@item ESingular-@value{VERSION}
Contains The @sc{ESingular}, the most comfortable Singular interface.
Requires XEmacs.
        @end table
@item @strong{Help Files:}
@table @code
@item WinHelp
Contains Singular Manual, converted to Windows help format (.hlp).
We recommend to install it, because it is small and is set by default
in all the Singular executables.
@item HTML Help
Contains "native" Singular Manual. It's not included by default,
because it is much bigger than WinHelp, though it has better formatting
of mathematical formulae.
@end table
@end table

@heading Downloading preliminaries

To install @sc{Singular} on a PC running Windows 95/98/NT/2K, you need
to download @emph{one} of the following archive files:

@table @code
@item Singular-@value{VERSION}-Compact.exe
Minimal archive to download. Contains the @code{BasicCygwin},
@code{Singular-@value{VERSION}} and @code{WinHelp} components.
@item Singular-@value{VERSION}-Typical.exe
Typical archive to download. Contains the @code{BasicCygwin},
@code{Singular-@value{VERSION}},@code{XEmacs},
@code{ESingular-@value{VERSION}},@code{WinHelp} and @code{HTML Help}
components.

@end table

You can obtain these (and other) archives from
@display
@uref{ftp://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/pub/Math/Singular/}.
@end display

@include register.texi

@heading Installing SINGULAR

The recent Setup program analyzes your system, e.g. detecting
whether Cygwin is present and functional. Then it gives you
hints and/or error messages with instructions during the installation.

@table @code
@item If you have Cygwin installed
        If the version of @code{cygwin1.dll} is not less than 1.1.8,
        you will be prompted that the @code{BasicCygwin} component will not
        be installed. Moreover, the Cygwin root directory will be proposed as
        the default installation directory. You can accept it, then
        @code{Singular} will be placed into the existing Cygwin environment.
        If you choose another destination, @code{Singular} will use Cygwin
        programs anyway. If your Cygwin has incorrect settings (like
        inconsistent mount points among the important ones), @code{Singular}
        Setup will correct them.

@item If you have XEmacs installed
        The @code{Cygwin} port of XEmacs version 21.1.12 with the most
        important packages is included in the distribution. The use of
        non-@code{Cygwin} ports
        or earlier @code{Cygwin} ports has some quirks and does not work
        properly together with @code{Singular} (i.e., running @code{ESingular}
        results in problems). Nevertheless, if you want to test the
        compatibility of @code{ESingular} with your own @code{XEmacs}, just
        de-select the XEmacs component, but leave @code{ESingular} selected.
        If your XEmacs would be incompatible with ESingular, you can
        install just the XEmacs component and use in fact two different
        XEmacs programs.
        The setup program will search for XEmacs and packages
        in <TARGETDIR>/usr/local/lib. Here <TARGETDIR> is the directory
        which you selected while running setup. If you have @code{Cygwin} and/or
        XEmacs, you might have XEmacs installed there. To avoid the overwriting
        of your XEmacs files, setup will ask you what to do.
@end table

@heading Customizing SINGULAR

The following step(s) are optional:
@itemize
@item
To conveniently access all files on your computer, mount the drives of
your disk(s):
@enumerate
@item
Open a bash shell.
@item
For each drive (letter) issue the following command (the drive @code{C:}
is used in the example):
@example
mount -f -s -t C: /C
@end example
@end enumerate
After mounting the drive(s) this way, you can conveniently access the
files on a drive from the bash and from XEmacs using the @code{/C/}
prefix.

@item
Create your personal @code{HOME} directory.
@*Various applications (e.g., @code{bash} or @code{XEmacs}) store
user-specific configuration/customization files in the @code{HOME}
directory of the current user. During the installation, the @code{HOME}
directory is globally set for all users to @code{/home/Singular}. To
create your individual  @code{HOME} directory follow these steps:
@enumerate
@item
Create a directory (folder), say, @code{C:\home\MyHome}.
@item
Copy all files from @code{/home/Singular} to @code{C:\home\MyHome}.
@item
Set the _user_ environment variable @code{HOME} to @code{C:\home\MyHome}:
@*On Windows 95/98, edit the respective line the @code{AUTOEXEC.BAT}
file.
@*On Windows NT/2K add an entry in your @code{Environment} control
panel.
@item
Restart your computer (On Windows 95/98).
@end enumerate
You may furthermore examine the files copied into your  @code{HOME}
directory and adjust (i.e. edit) them to your personal
preferences/needs.

@end itemize

@heading Uninstalling Singular

You can uninstall individual or all installed components by opening the
@code{Software} panel of the @code{System configuration} control
panel. Simply double-click the @code{Singular-@value{VERSION}} item and
follow the instructions given there.


For any other troubles,
please send an email to @email{singular@@mathematik.uni-kl.de}
and include the header which is displayed by starting up @sc{Singular}
with the @code{-v} option, and a description of your machine and
operating system.
