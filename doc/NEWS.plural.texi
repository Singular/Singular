The current version @value{VERSION} is the first pre-release
of the upcoming release series version 2-2. Therefore, some
command names are subject to change. 

Singular::Plural version 2-1 is generally much faster than any previous
experimental version of Singular::Plural, due to a rewrite of major parts 
of the Singular kernel (e.g., the kernel has a new memory manager 
and a new polynomial arithmetic) 
and due to new and better implemented algorithms 
(e.g., for two-sided Gr"obner bases).

Besides theses internal changes, Singular version 2 offers many new
features and functionalities 

@heading Efficiency Improvements
The following table shows some timings which compare the efficincy of
Singular:Plural version 0-9-9 and Singular version 2-1-2. 
All times are in seconds
and were obtained on HP 160 workstation with 512 MB RAM running HP-UX 10.20.

@heading (Commutative) Factorizing algorithms revisited
Starting with version 2-0-4, we use NTL (of Victor Shoup) for factoring
univariate polynomials. The multivariate factoring code in libfac/factory
does now also work over algebraic extension fields.

@heading Internal Changes
@table @asis
@item new data structures for monomials and polynomials
Makes polynomial arithmetic significantly faster: Especially for block -
or weighted orderings.
Bucket representation of polynomials in std and NF;
Ring change during std-related computations
(resulting in more speed and less space consumption).
@item new memory management
Results is less memory usage, faster memory allocation/free, less
fragmentation, much better locality of reference.
