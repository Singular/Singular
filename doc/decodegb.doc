@comment this file contains the mathematical background of decoding with Groebner bases

This section introduces some of the mathematical notions, definitions, and
results for solving decoding problems and finding the minimum distance of
linear (and in particular cyclic) codes. The material presented here
should assist the user in working with @ref{decodegb_lib}.

  The code $C$ is {\bf cyclic}, if for every codeword ${\bf c}=(c_0,\dots,c_{n-1})$ in $C$ its
  cyclic shift $(c_{n-1},c_0,\dots,c_{n-2})$ is again a codeword in $C$.
  When working with cyclic codes, vectors are usually presented as polynomials.
  So ${\bf c}$ is represented by the polynomial $c(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}c_ix^i$ with $x^n=1$, more
  precisely $c(x)$ is an element of the factor ring $F_q[X]/\langle X^n-1 \rangle$.
  Cyclic codes over $F_q$ of length $n$ correspond one-to-one to ideals in this factor ring.
  We assume for cyclic codes that $(q,n)=1$. Let $F=F_{q^m}$ be
  the splitting field of $X^n-1$ over $F_q$. Then $F$ has a {\bf primitive $n$-th root of unity} which will be denoted by $a$.
  A cyclic code is uniquely given by a {\bf defining set} $S_C$ which is a subset of $Z\!\!\! Z_n$ such that
  $$
    c(x) \in C \ \hbox{ if } \ c(a ^i )=0 \ \hbox{ for all } \ i \in S_C.
  $$
  A cyclic code has several defining sets.
@end tex
@ifinfo
  The code C is @strong{cyclic}, if for every codeword c=(c_0,@dots{},c_(n-1)) in C its
  cyclic shift (c_(n-1),c_0,@dots{},c_(n-2)) is again a codeword in C.
  When working with cyclic codes, vectors are usually presented as polynomials.
  So c is represented by the polynomial c(x)=sum_(i=0)^(n-1)c_i x^i$ with x^n=1, more
  precisely c(x) is an element of the factor ring F_q[X]/<X^n-1>.
  Cyclic codes over F_q of length n correspond one-to-one to ideals in this factor ring.
  We assume for cyclic codes that (q,n)=1. Let F=F_(q^m) be

@subsubheading Finding the minimum distance
The method described above can be adapted to find the minimum distance of a code.
More concretely, the following holds:

@tex
  Let $C$ be the binary $[n,k,d]$ cyclic code with the defining set $S_C=\{i_1,\dots,i_v\}$. Let $1\le w\le n$ and let $J_C(w)$ denote the system:
  $$
  Z_1^{i_1}+\dots+Z_w^{i_1}=0,
  $$
  $$
  \vdots
  $$
  $$
  Z_1^{i_v}+\dots+Z_w^{i_v}=0,
  $$
  $$
  Z_1^n-1=0,
  $$
  $$
  \vdots
  $$
  $$
  Z_w^n-1=0,
  $$
  $$
  p(n,Z_i,Z_j)=0, 1\le i<j\le w.
  $$
@end tex
@ifinfo
  Let C be the binary [n,k,d] cyclic code with the defining set
  S_C=@{i_1,@dots{},i_v@}. Let 1<= w<= n and let J_C(w) denote the system:

  Z_1^(i_1)+@dots{}+Z_w^(i_1)=0,

  Z_w^n-1=0,
  p(n,Z_i,Z_j)=0,1<= i<j<= w.
  @end display
@end ifinfo
@tex
  Then the number of solutions of $J_C(w)$ is equal to $w!$ times the number of codewords of weight $w$. And for $1\le w\le d$, either $J_C(w)$
  has no solutions, which is equivalent to $w<d$, or $J_C(w)$ has some solutions, which is equivalent to $w=d$.
@end tex
@ifinfo
Then the number of solutions of J_C(w) is equal to w!

  In this way we obtain that the code $C$ is the image of the evaluation above, thus $C=C(I,L)$. In the
  same way by considering a parity check matrix instead of a generator matrix we have that the dual code is also an affine variety code.

  The method of decoding is a generalization of CRHT. One needs to add polynomials
  $(g_l(X_{k1},\dots,X_{ks}))_{l=1,\dots,m; k=1,\dots,t}$ for every error position. We also assume that field equations on $X_{ij}$'s are included
  among the polynomials above. Let $C$ be a $q$-ary $[n,k]$ linear code such that its
  dual is written as an affine variety code of the form $C^{\bot}=C(I,L)$.
  Let ${\bf r}={\bf c}+{\bf e}$ as usual and $t\le e$. Then the syndromes are computed by $s_i=\sum_{j=1}^nr_jf_i(P_j)=\sum_{j=1}^ne_jf_i(P_j)

  Let ${\bf b}_1,\dots,{\bf b}_n$ be a basis of $F_q^n$ and let $B$ be the $n \times n$ matrix with
  ${\bf b}_1,\dots,{\bf b}_n$ as rows. The {\bf unknown syndrome} ${\bf u}(B,{\bf e})$ of a word ${\bf e}$ w.r.t $B$
  is the column vector ${\bf u}(B,{\bf e})=B{\bf e}^T$ with entries $u_i(B,{\bf e})={\bf b}_i\cdot {\bf e}$ for $i=1,\dots,n$.

  For two vectors ${\bf x,y} \in F_q^n$ define
  ${\bf x*y}=(x_1y_1,\dots,x_ny_n)$. Then ${\bf b}_i*{\bf b_j}$ is a linear combination of
  ${\bf b}_1,\dots,{\bf b}_n$, so there are constants $\mu^{ij}_l\in F_q $ such that
  ${\bf b}_i*{\bf b}_j = \sum_{l=1}^n \mu^{ij}_l{\bf b}_l.$
  The elements $\mu^{ij}_l\in F_q$ are the {\bf structure constants} of the basis ${\bf b}_1,\dots,{\bf b}_n$.

  Let $B_s$ be the $s \times n$ matrix with ${\bf b}_1,\dots,{\bf b}_s$ as rows ($B=B_n$).
  Then ${\bf b}_1,\dots,{\bf b}_n$ is an {\bf ordered MDS basis} and $B$ an {\bf MDS matrix} if all
  the $s\times s$ submatrices of $B_s$ have rank $s$ for all $s=1 ,\dots ,n$.

is the column vector u(B,e)=Be^T with entries u_i(B,e)=b_i * e for i=1,@dots{},n.

For two vectors x,y in F_q^n define
x*y=(x_1 y_1,@dots{},x_n y_n). Then b_i*b_j is a linear combination of
b_1,@dots{},b_n, so there are constants mu^(ij)_l in F_q such that
b_i*b_j = sum_(l=1)^n mu^(ij)_l b_l.
The elements mu^(ij)_l in F_q are the @strong{structure constants} of the basis b_1,@dots{},b_n.

Let B_s be the s x n matrix with b_1,@dots{},b_s as rows (B=B_n).
Then b_1,@dots{},b_n is an @strong{ordered MDS basis} and B an @strong{MDS matrix} if all

@subsubheading Expressing known syndromes
@tex
  Let $C$ be an $F_q$-linear code with parameters $[n,k,d]$. W.l.o.g $n\le q$. $H$ is a check matrix of $C$.
  Let ${\bf h}_1,\dots,{\bf h}_{n-k}$ be the rows of $H$.
  One can express ${\bf h}_i = \sum _{j=1}^n a_{ij}{\bf b}_j$ with some $a_{ij}\in F_q$.
  In other words $H=AB$ where $A$ is the $(n-k) \times n$ matrix with entries $a_{ij}$.

  Let ${\bf r}={\bf c}+{\bf e}$ be a received word with ${\bf c}\in C$ and ${\bf e}$ an error vector.
  The syndromes of ${\bf r}$ and ${\bf e}$ w.r.t $H$ are equal and known:
  $$
    s_i({\bf r}):={\bf h}_i \cdot {\bf r}={\bf h}_i\cdot {\bf e}=s_i({\bf e}).
  $$
  They can be expressed in the unknown syndromes of ${\bf e}$ w.r.t $B$:
  $$
    s_i({\bf r})=s_i({\bf e}) =\sum _{j=1}^n a_{ij}u_j({\bf e})
  $$
  since ${\bf h}_i = \sum _{j=1}^n a_{ij}{\bf b}_j$ and ${\bf b}_j \cdot {\bf e}=u_j({\bf e})$.
