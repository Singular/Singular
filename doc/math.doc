Let $R = \hbox{Loc}_< K[\underline{x}]$ and let $I$ be a submodule of $R^r$.
Note that for r=1 this means that $I$ is an ideal in $R$.
Denote by $L(I)$ the submodule of $R^r$ generated by the leading terms
of elements of $I$, i.e. by $\left\{L(f) \mid f \in I\right\}$.
Then $f_1, \ldots, f_s \in I$ is called a {\bf standard basis} of $I$
if $L(f_1), \ldots, L(f_s)$ generate $L(I)$.

A standard basis is {\bf minimal} if $\forall i: (f_1,..,f_{i-1},f_{i+1},..,f_s) \neq I$.

A minimal standard basis is {\bf completely reduced} if $\forall i: {\tt reduce}(f_i,(f_1,..,f_{i-1},f_{i+1},..,f_s))=f_i$

Let M $=\bigoplus_{i\in Z} M_i$ be a graded module over $K[x_1,..,x_n]$ with
respect to weights $(w_1,..w_n)$.
The {\bf Hilbert function} of $M$, $H_M$, is defined (on the integers) by
$$H_M(k) :=dim_K M_k.$$
The {\bf Hilbert-Poincare series}  of $M$ is the power series
$$\hbox{HP}_M(t) :=\sum_{i=-\infty}^\infty
H_M(i)t^i=\sum_{i=-\infty}^\infty dim_K M_i \cdot t^i.$$
It turns out that $\hbox{HP}_M(t)$ can be written in two useful ways
for weights $(1,..,1)$:
$$\hbox{HP}_M(t)={Q(t)\over (1-t)^n}={P(t)\over (1-t)^{dim(M)}}$$
where $Q(t)$ and $P(t)$ are polynomials in ${\bf Z}[t]$.
$Q(t)$ is called the {\bf first Hilbert series},
and $P(t)$ the {\bf second Hilbert series}.
If \hbox{$P(t)=\sum_{k=0}^N a_k t^k$}, and \hbox{$d = dim(M)$},
then \hbox{$H_M(s)=\sum_{k=0}^N a_k$ ${d+s-k-1}\choose{d-1}$}
(the {\bf Hilbert polynomial}) for $s \ge N$.

@end display
where Q(t) and P(t) are polynomials in Z[t].
Q(t) is called the first Hilbert series, and P(t) the second Hilbert series.

Let $<$ be the lexicographical ordering on $R=K[x_1,...,x_n]$ with $x_1
< ... < x_n$.
For $f \in R$ let lvar($f$) (the leading variable of $f$) be the largest
variable in $f$,
i.e., if $f=a_s(x_1,...,x_{k-1})x_k^s+...+a_0(x_1,...,x_{k-1})$ for some
$k \leq n$ then lvar$(f)=x_k$.

Moreover, let
\hbox{ini}$(f):=a_s(x_1,...,x_{k-1})$. The pseudoremainder
$r=\hbox{prem}(g,f)$ of $g$ with respect to $f$ is
defined by the equality $\hbox{ini}(f)^a\cdot g = qf+r$ with
$\hbox{deg}_{lvar(f)}(r)<\hbox{deg}_{lvar(f)}(f)$ and $a$
minimal.

A set $T=\{f_1,...,f_r\} \subset R$ is called triangular if
$\hbox{lvar}(f_1)<...<\hbox{lvar}(f_r)$. Moreover, let $ U \subset T $,
then $(T,U)$ is called a triangular system, if $T$ is a triangular set
such that $\hbox{ini}(T)$ does not vanish on $V(T) \setminus V(U)
(=:V(T\setminus U))$.

$T$ is called irreducible if for every $i$ there are no

$$   \hbox{lvar}(d_i)<\hbox{lvar}(f_i) =

$$\hbox{prem}(d_if_i-f_i'f_i'',\{f_1,...,f_{i-1}\})=0.$$
Furthermore, $(T,U)$ is called irreducible if $T$ is irreducible.

The main result on triangular sets is the following: Let
$G=\{g_1,...,g_s\} \subset R$, then there are irreducible triangular sets $T_1,...,T_l$
such that $V(G)=\bigcup_{i=1}^{l}(V(T_i\setminus I_i))$

(T,U) is called a triangular system, if U is a subset of T and
if T is a triangular set such that ini(T)

Let $f\colon(C^{n+1},0)\rightarrow(C,0)$ be a complex isolated hypersurface singularity given by a polynomial with algebraic coefficients which we also denote by $f$.
Let $O=C[x_0,\ldots,x_n]_{(x_0,\ldots,x_n)}$ be the local ring at the origin and $J_f$ the Jacobian ideal of $f$.

A {\bf Milnor representative} of $f$ defines a differentiable fibre bundle over the punctured disc with fibres of homotopy type of $\mu$ $n$-spheres.
The $n$-th cohomology bundle is a flat vector bundle of dimension $n$ and carries a natural flat connection with covariant derivative $\partial_t$.
The {\bf monodromy operator} is the action of a positively oriented generator of the fundamental group of the punctured disc on the Milnor fibre.
Sections in the cohomology bundle of {\bf moderate growth} at $0$ form a regular $D=C\{t\}[\partial_t]$-module $G$, the {\bf Gauss-Manin connection}.

By integrating along flat multivalued families of cycles, one can consider fibrewise global holomorphic differential forms as elements of $G$.
This factors through an inclusion of the {\bf Brieskorn lattice} $H'':=\Omega^{n+1}_{C^{n+1},0}/df\wedge d\Omega^{n-1}_{C^{n+1},0}$ in $G$.

The $D$-module structure defines the {\bf V-filtration} $V$ on $G$ by $V^\alpha:=\sum_{\beta\ge\alpha}C\{t\}ker(t\partial_t-\beta)^{n+1}$.
The Brieskorn lattice defines the {\bf Hodge filtration} $F$ on $G$ by $F_k=\partial_t^kH''$ which comes from the {\bf mixed Hodge structure} on the Milnor fibre.
Note that $F_{-1}=H'$.

The induced V-filtration on the Brieskorn lattice determines the {\bf singularity spectrum} $Sp$ by $Sp(\alpha):=\dim_CGr_V^\alpha Gr^F_0G$.
The spectrum consists of $\mu$ rational numbers $\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_\mu$ such that $e^{2\pi i\alpha_1},\dots,e^{2\pi i\alpha_\mu}$ are the eigenvalues of the monodromy.
These {\bf spectral numbers} lie in the open interval $(-1,n)$, symmetric about the midpoint $(n-1)/2$.

The spectrum is constant under $\mu$-constant deformations and has the following semicontinuity property:
The number of spectral numbers in an interval $(a,a+1]$ of all singularities of a small deformation of $f$ is greater than or equal to that of f in this interval.
For semiquasihomogeneous singularities, this also holds for intervals of the form $(a,a+1)$.

Two given isolated singularities $f$ and $g$ determine two spectra and from these spectra we get an integer.
This integer is the maximal positive integer $k$ such that the semicontinuity holds for the spectrum of $f$ and $k$ times the spectrum of $g$.
These numbers give bounds for the maximal number of isolated singularities of a specific type on a hypersurface $X\subset{P}^n$ of degree $d$:
such a hypersurface has a smooth hyperplane section, and the complement is a small deformation of a cone over this hyperplane section.
The cone itself being a $\mu$-constant deformation of $x_0^d+\dots+x_n^d=0$, the singularities are bounded by the spectrum of $x_0^d+\dots+x_n^d$.

Using the library {\tt gmssing.lib} one can compute the {\bf monodromy}, the V-fitration on $H''/H'$, and the spectrum.

Here @code{l[1]} contains the spectral numbers, @code{l[2]} the corresponding multiplicities, @code{l[3]} a @math{C}-basis of the V-filtration on @math{H''/H'} in terms of the monomial basis of
@tex
$O/J_f\cong H''/H'$
@end tex
@ifinfo
O/J_f~=H''/H'
@end ifinfo
in @code{l[4]} (seperated by degree).

@tex
If the principal part of $f$ is $C$-nondegenerate, one can compute the spectrum using the library {\tt spectrum.lib}.
In this case, the V-filtration on $H''$ coincides with the Newton-filtration on $H''$ which allows to compute the spectrum more efficiently.

Let us calculate one specific example, the maximal number
of triple points of type
@tex
$\tilde{E}_6$ on a surface $X\subset{P}^3$
@end tex
@ifinfo
E~_6 on a surface X in P^3
@end ifinfo
of degree seven.
This calculation can be done over the rationals.
We choose a local ordering on @math{Q[x,y,z]}. Here we take the
negative degree lexicographical ordering, in @sc{Singular} denoted by @code{ds}:

@smallexample
@c example
ring r=0,(x,y,z),ds;
LIB "spectrum.lib";
poly f=x^7+y^7+z^7;
list s1=spectrumnd( f );
s1;
@c example
@end smallexample

The command @code{spectrumnd(f)} computes the spectrum of @math{f} and
returns a list with six entries:
The Milnor number
@tex
$\mu(f)$, the geometric genus $p_g(f)$
@end tex
@ifinfo
mu(f), the geometric genus p_g(f)
@end ifinfo
and the number of different spectrum numbers.
The other three entries are of type @code{intvec}.
They contain the numerators, denominators and
multiplicities of the spectrum numbers. So
@tex
$x^7+y^7+z^7=0$
@end tex
@ifinfo
x^7+y^7+z^7=0
@end ifinfo
has Milnor number 216 and geometrical
genus 35. Its spectrum consists of the 16 different rationals
@*
@tex
${3 \over 7}, {4 \over 7}, {5 \over 7}, {6 \over 7}, {1 \over 1},
{8 \over 7}, {9 \over 7}, {10 \over 7}, {11 \over 7}, {12 \over 7},
{13 \over 7}, {2 \over 1}, {15 \over 7}, {16 \over 7}, {17 \over 7},
{18 \over 7}$
@end tex
@ifinfo
3/7, 4/7, 5/7, 6/7, 1, 8/7, 9/7, 10/7, 11/7, 12/7, 13/7, 2, 15/7, 16/7, 17/7,
18/7
@end ifinfo
@*appearing with multiplicities
@*1,3,6,10,15,21,25,27,27,25,21,15,10,6,3,1.

@tex
The singularities of type $\tilde{E}_6$ form a
$\mu$-constant one parameter family given by
$x^3+y^3+z^3+\lambda xyz=0,\quad \lambda^3\neq-27$.
@end tex
@ifinfo
The singularities of type E~_6 form a
mu-constant one parameter family given by
x^3+y^3+z^3+lambda xyz=0, lambda^3 <> -27.
@end ifinfo
Therefore they have all the same spectrum, which we compute
for
@tex
$x^3+y^3+z^3$.
@end tex
@ifinfo
@math{x^3+y^3+z^3}.
@end ifinfo

@end smallexample
Evaluating semicontinuity is very easy:
@smallexample
semicont(s1,s2);
@expansion{} 18
@end smallexample

This tells us that there are at most 18 singularities of type
@tex
$\tilde{E}_6$ on a septic in $P^3$. But $x^7+y^7+z^7$
@end tex
@ifinfo
E~_6 on a septic in P^3. But x^7+y^7+z^7
@end ifinfo
is semiquasihomogeneous (sqh), so we can also apply the stronger
form of semicontinuity:

@smallexample
semicontsqh(s1,s2);
@expansion{} 17
@end smallexample

So in fact a septic has at most 17 triple points of type
@tex
$\tilde{E}_6$.
@end tex
@ifinfo
E~_6.
@end ifinfo

Note that @code{spectrumnd(f)} works only if @math{f} has a nondegenerate
principal part. In fact @code{spectrumnd} will detect a degenerate
principal part in many cases and print out an error message.
However if it is known in advance that @math{f} has nondegenerate
principal part, then the spectrum may be computed much faster
using @code{spectrumnd(f,1)}.
