Let $A$ denote an $m\times n$ matrix with integral coefficients. For $u
\in Z\!\!\! Z^n$, we define $u^+,u^-$ to be the uniquely determined
vectors with nonnegative coefficients and disjoint support (i.e.,
$u_i^+=0$ or $u_i^-=0$ for each component $i$) such that
$u=u^+-u^-$. For $u\geq 0$ component-wise, let $x^u$ denote the monomial
$x_1^{u_1}\cdot\ldots\cdot x_n^{u_n}\in K[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$.

The ideal
$$ I_A:=(x^{u^+}-x^{u^-} | u\in\ker(A)\cap Z\!\!\! Z^n)\ \subset
K[x_1,\ldots,x_n] $$
is called a \bf toric ideal. \rm

The first problem in computing toric ideals is to find a finite
generating set: Let $v_1,\ldots,v_r$ be a lattice basis of $\ker(A)\cap
Z\!\!\! Z^n$ (i.e, a basis of the $Z\!\!\! Z$-module). Then
$$ I_A:=I:(x_1\cdot\ldots\cdot x_n)^\infty $$
where
$$ I=<x^{v_i^+}-x^{v_i^-}|i=1,\ldots,r> $$

For u>=0 component-wise, let x^u

The algorithm of Conti and Traverso (@pxref{[CoTr91]})
@tex
computes $I_A$ via the
extended matrix $B=(I_m|A)$,
where $I_m$ is the $m\times m$ unity matrix. A lattice basis of $B$ is
given by the set of vectors $(a^j,-e_j)\in Z\!\!\! Z^{m+n}$, where $a^j$
is the $j$-th row of $A$ and $e_j$ the $j$-th coordinate vector. We
look at the ideal in $K[y_1,\ldots,y_m,x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ corresponding to
these vectors, namely
$$ I_1=<y^{a_j^+}- x_j y^{a_j^-} | j=1,\ldots, n>.$$
We introduce a further variable $t$ and adjoin the binomial $t\cdot
y_1\cdot\ldots\cdot y_m -1$ to the generating set of $I_1$, obtaining
an ideal $I_2$ in the polynomial ring $K[t,
y_1,\ldots,y_m,x_1,\ldots,x_n]$. $I_2$ is saturated w.r.t. all
variables because all variables are invertible modulo $I_2$. Now $I_A$
can be computed from $I_2$ by eliminating the variables
$t,y_1,\ldots,y_m$.

Because of the big number of auxiliary variables needed to compute a
toric ideal, this algorithm is rather slow in practice. However, it has
a special importance in the application to integer programming
(@pxref{Integer programming}).

The algorithm of Hosten and Sturmfels (@pxref{[HoSt95]}) allows to
@tex
compute $I_A$ without any auxiliary variables, provided that $A$ contains a vector $w$
with positive coefficients in its row space. This is a real restriction,
i.e., the algorithm will not necessarily work in the general case.

A lattice basis $v_1,\ldots,v_r$ is again computed via the
LLL-algorithm.
The saturation step is performed in the following way:
First note that $w$ induces a positive grading w.r.t. which the ideal
$$ I=<x^{v_i^+}-x^{v_i^-}|i=1,\ldots,r> $$
corresponding to our lattice basis is homogeneous. We use the following
lemma:

Let $I$ be a homogeneous ideal w.r.t. the weighted reverse
lexicographical ordering with weight vector $w$ and variable order $x_1
> x_2 > \ldots > x_n$. Let $G$ denote a Groebner basis of $I$ w.r.t.
this ordering.  Then a Groebner basis of $(I:x_n^\infty)$ is obtained by
dividing each element of $G$ by the highest possible power of $x_n$.

From this fact, we can succesively compute
$$ I_A= I:(x_1\cdot\ldots\cdot x_n)^\infty
=(((I:x_1^\infty):x_2^\infty):\ldots :x_n^\infty); $$
in the $i$-th step we take $x_i$ as the smallest variable and apply the
lemma with $x_i$ instead of $x_n$.

This procedure involves $n$ Groebner basis computations. Actually, this
number can be reduced to at most $n/2$

@cindex Di Biase-Urbanke algorithm
@cindex algorithm of Di Biase and Urbanke

Like the algorithm of Hosten and Sturmfels, the algorithm of Di Biase
and Urbanke (@pxref{[DBUr95]}) performs up
@tex
to $n/2$ Groebner basis
computations. It needs no auxiliary variables, but a supplementary
precondition; namely, the existence of a vector without zero components
in the kernel of $A$.

The main idea comes from the following observation:

Let $B$ be an integer matrix, $u_1,\ldots,u_r$ a lattice basis of the
integer kernel of $B$. Assume that all components of $u_1$ are
positive. Then
$$ I_B=<x^{u_i^+}-x^{u_i^-}|i=1,\ldots,r>, $$
i.e., the ideal on the right is already saturated w.r.t. all variables.

The algorithm starts by finding a lattice basis $v_1,\ldots,v_r$ of the
kernel of $A$ such that $v_1$ has no zero component. Let
$\{i_1,\ldots,i_l\}$ be the set of indices $i$ with
$v_{1,i}<0$. Multiplying the components $i_1,\ldots,i_l$ of
$v_1,\ldots,v_r$ and the columns $i_1,\ldots,i_l$ of $A$ by $-1$ yields
a matrix $B$ and a lattice basis $u_1,\ldots,u_r$ of the kernel of $B$
that fulfill the assumption of the observation above. It is then able
to compute a generating set of $I_A$ by applying the following
``variable flip'' successively to $i=i_1,\ldots,i_l$:

Let $>$ be an elimination ordering for $x_i$. Let $A_i$ be the matrix
obtained by multiplying the $i$-th column of $A$ by $-1$. Let
$$\{x_i^{r_j} x^{a_j} - x^{b_j} | j\in J \}$$
be a Groebner basis of $I_{A_i}$ w.r.t. $>$ (where $x_i$ is neither
involved in $x^{a_j}$ nor in $x^{b_j}$). Then
$$\{x^{a_j} - x_i^{r_j} x^{b_j} | j\in J \}$$
is a generating set for $I_A$.

@subsection The Buchberger algorithm for toric ideals
@cindex Buchberger algorithm for toric ideals

Toric ideals have a very special structure that allows us to improve
the Buchberger algorithm in many aspects: They are prime ideals and
generated by binomials. Pottier used this fact to describe all
operations of the Buchberger algorithm on the ideal generators in terms
of vector additions and subtractions. Some other strategies like
multiple reduction (@pxref{[CoTr91]}) or the use of bit
vectors to represent the support of a monomial (@pxref{[Big97]}) may be
applied to more general ideals, but show to
be especially useful in the toric case.

@tex
Let $A$ be an $m\times n$ matrix with integral coefficients, $b\in
Z\!\!\! Z^m$ and $c\in Z\!\!\! Z^n$. The problem
$$ \min\{c^T x | x\in Z\!\!\! Z^n, Ax=b, x\geq 0\hbox{
component-wise}\} $$
is called an instance of the \bf integer programming problem \rm or
\bf IP problem. \rm

The IP problem is very hard; namely, it is NP-complete.

For the following discussion let $c\geq 0$ (component-wise). We
consider $c$ as a weight vector; because of its nonnegativity, $c$ can
be refined into a monomial ordering $>_c$. It turns out that we can
solve such an IP instance with the help of toric ideals:

First we assume that an initial solution $v$ (i.e., $v\in Z\!\!\!
Z^n, v\geq 0, Av=b$) is already known. We obtain the optimal solution
$v_0$ (i.e., with $c^T v_0$ minimal) by the following procedure:
@end tex
@c \begin{itemize}
@c \item (1) Compute the toric ideal $I_A$ using one of the algorithms in the
@c       previous section.
@c \item (2) Compute the reduced Groebner basis $G_c$ of $I_A$ w.r.t.
@c       $>_c$.
@c \item (3) Reduce $x^v$ modulo $G_c$ using the Hironaka division algorithm.
@c       If the result of this reduction is $x^{v_0}$, then $v_0$ is an
@c       optimal solution of the given instance.
@c \end{itemize}

@ifinfo
Let A be an mxn matrix with integral coefficients, b in Z^m and c in
Z^n. The problem @*
@display
min @{ c*x | x in Z^n, A*x=b, x>=0 component-wise @}
@end display
is called an instance of the @strong{integer programming problem} or
@strong{IP problem}.

The IP problem is very hard; namely, it is NP-complete.

For the following discussion let c>=0 (component-wise). We
consider c as a weight vector; because of its nonnegativity, c can
be refined into a monomial ordering >_c. It turns out that we can
solve such an IP instance with the help of toric ideals:

First we assume that an initial solution v (i.e., v in Z^n, v>=0,
A*v=b) is already known. We obtain the optimal solution v(opt) (i.e.,
with c*v(opt) minimal) by the following procedure:
@end ifinfo

@itemize @bullet
@item (1) Compute the toric ideal I(A) using one of the algorithms in the previous section.
@item (2) Compute the reduced Groebner basis G(c) of I(A) w.r.t.@: @math{>_c}.
@item (3) Reduce @math{x^v} modulo G(c) using the Hironaka division algorithm.
If the result of this reduction is @math{x^w}, then @math{w} is an optimal
solution of the given instance.
@end itemize

If no initial solution is known, we are nevertheless able to solve the
problem with similar techniques. For this purpose we replace our
instance by an extended instance with the matrix used
in the Conti-Traverso algorithm. Indeed, the Conti-Traverso
algorithm offers the possibility to verify solvability of a given
instance and to find an initial solution in the case of existence (but
none of the other algorithms does!). Details can be found in @pxref{[CoTr91]}
and @pxref{[The99]}.

An implementation of the above algorithm and some examples can be found in @ref{intprog_lib}.

Classical methods for solving IP instances like Branch-and-Bound
methods seem to be faster in general than the methods using toric
ideals. But the latter have one great advantage: If one wants to solve
various instances that differ only by the vector @math{b}, one has to
perform steps (1) and (2) above only once. As the running time of step (3)
is very short, solving all the instances is not much harder than
solving one single instance.

For a detailed discussion see @pxref{[The99]}.
