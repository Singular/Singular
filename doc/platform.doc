@c The following directives are necessary for proper compilation
@c with emacs (C-c C-e C-r).  Please keep it as it is.  Since it
@c is wrapped in `@ignore' and `@end ignore' it does not harm `tex' or
@c `makeinfo' but is a great help in editing this file (emacs
@c ignores the `@ignore').

Installation of the provided binaries

Do not try to use the Finder for the installation!

After inserting the CD open a terminal (under /Applications/Utilities) and
type the following commands (you need an Admin Account):

sudo tar -xvzf /Volumes/CDROM/MAC/OSX/Singular-3-0-3-ppcMac-darwin.tar.gz

sudo tar -xvzf /Volumes/CDROM/MAC/OSX/Singular-3-0-3-share.tar.gz

sudo ln -sf /usr/local/Singular/3-0-3/ppcMac-darwin/Singular /usr/local/bin/Singular-3-0-3

The first two commands unpack the tar.gz files and copy the Singular
files (binaries and documentation, libs, etc) to /usr/local/Singular/3-0-3.

The last command creates a link in /usr/local/bin so that you can just type
Singular-3-0-3
to run Singular in any terminal.


(The expert might wish to read the INSTALL_unix.html file in the UNIX
directory for alternatives).

Installation via fink

Fink is a well-known package format for Mac OS X.
(see http://fink.sf.net)

There are two packages: singular-doc and singular.

They are available for 10.3 and 10.4 (in fink called 10.4-transitional).

If you have fink installed, try one of the two possibilities:

@itemize
@item
   type in a shell:
     @code{fink selfupdate}
     @*@code{fink install singular singular-doc}

@item
(using the Fink Commander):

   @itemize
   @item
   Start your Fink Commander
   @item
   After updating the package list,
   there should appear "singular" and "singular-doc" as packages
   @item
   Install it from sources (fink will do that automatic for you).
   @end itemize

@end itemize
