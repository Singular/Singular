@heading News for version @value{VERSION}

This version starts some reorganization: a section for new libraries:
(see @nref{Experimental libraries}), preparations for parallel computations
(see @nref{modstd_lib}, @nref{Ssi links}), some linear algebra (see below),
many new libaries, 
many bug fixes etc.
(especially factorization stuff and memory management).
