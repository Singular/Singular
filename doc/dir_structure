Audience and their wishes:
A) Developer
A1  - several independent versions of Singular
A2  - developer version: additional commands, main sources in the current
    directory or "nearby"
B) User
B1   - binaries installable without administrator privileges
B2   - sources installable without administrator privileges
C) Administrator
C1   - installable without conflicts
C2   - installable for several binary architectures
C3   - few dependencies

What to install ?
- sub-projects
  - have:
     - libraries
     - public headers
     - private headers
  - can be
     - also used outside of Singular (factory etc.)
     - or: relatively useless outside of Singular (liboutput etc.)
- support files for Singular
  - gftables
    (currently: $SINGULARPATH/gftables:%b/LIB/gftables:%b/../LIB/gftables:%b/../../LIB/gftables)
  - libraries
    (currently: $SINGULARPATH:%b/LIB:%b/../LIB:%b/../../LIB)
  - system modules
    (currently %b)
  - user modules
    (currently: $SINGULARPATH:%b/MOD:%b/../MOD:%b/../../MOD)
  - index file
    (currently: %b/../doc/singular.idx)
  - info file
    (currently: %b/../info/singular.info)
  - HTML
    (currently: %b/../html)
  - examples (planned)
    (currently: %b/../examples)
  - emacs
    (currently: %b/../emacs)

Current layout
- compile everything inside the current working directory (A1, B2, C1)
- install into this tree (A2, C1)
- grammar.cc, scanner.cc etc can be build,
  but are usually included in the sources (C3: no need for flex/bison)
- all directories are relative to
   - the main binary location (A1,B1,C2)
   - or /usr/local/Singular/bin

 <version>/<arch>     directory for binaries (%b)
 <version>/<arch>/MOD directory for user modules (%b/MOD)
 <version>/emacs      directory for emacs scripts
 <version>/html, <version>/doc, <version>/info, <version>/examples
                      directories for help stuff
 <version>/LIB        directory for libraries
 <version>/LIB/gftables   directory for gftables
 <Build-dir>/<arch>/include directory for public headers
 <Build-dir>/<arch>/lib     directory for libraries
 <Build-dir>/Singular     directory for development version
                          LIB: <Build-dir>/Singular/LIB
                          everything else <Build-dir>/emacs,html,info,doc,...
