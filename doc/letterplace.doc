<h3> A Subsystem for Non-commutative Finitely Presented Algebras </h3>
<p></p>
@end html
@end ifhtml

This section describes mathematical notions and definitions used in
the @sc{Letterplace} subsystem of @sc{Singular}.

All algebras are assumed to be associative @math{K}-algebras for some field @math{K}.

What is @sc{Letterplace}? It is a subsystem of @sc{Singular}, providing the
manipulations and computations within free associative algebras
@math{K} @math{<x_1},@dots{},@math{x_n >} 
as well as in the factor-algebras of those by two-sided ideal.

Free algebras are represented in @sc{Singular} as so-called Letterplace rings. 
Each such ring is constructed from a commutative ring @math{K}[ @math{x_1},@dots{},@math{x_n} ] 
and a @strong{degree (length) bound} @math{d}.

This encodes a sub-@math{K}-vector space (also called a filtered part) of @math{K} @math{<x_1},@dots{},@math{x_n >},
spanned by all monomials of @strong{length} at most @math{d}.

@subsection Free associative algebras
@cindex free associative algebra, tensor algebra

Let @math{V} be a @math{K}-vector space, spanned by the symbols @math{x_1},@dots{},@math{x_n}.
A free associative algebra in @math{x_1},@dots{},@math{x_n} over @math{K}, denoted by @math{K} @math{< x_1},@dots{},@math{x_n >}
is also known as the tensor algebra @math{T(V)} of @math{V}; 
it is also the monoid @math{K}-algebra of the free monoid @math{< x_1},@dots{},@math{x_n >}. 
The elements of this free monoid constitute an infinite @math{K}-basis of @math{K} @math{< x_1},@dots{},@math{x_n >}, 
where the identity element (the empty word) of the free monoid is identified with the @math{1} in @math{K}. 
Yet in other words, the monomials of @math{K} @math{< x_1},@dots{},@math{x_n >} are the words
of finite length in the finite alphabet @{ @math{x_1},@dots{},@math{x_n} @}. 

The algebra @math{K} @math{< x_1},@dots{},@math{x_n >} is an integral domain, which is not (left, right, weak or two-sided) Noetherian for @math{n>1}; hence, a Groebner basis of a finitely generated ideal might be infinite. 
Therefore, a general computation takes place @strong{up to an explicit degree (length) bound}, provided by the user.
The free associative algebra can be regarded as a graded algebra in a natural way.

@strong{Definition}. An associative algebra @math{A} is called @strong{finitely presented (f.p.)}, if it is isomorphic to 
@math{K} @math{< x_1},@dots{},@math{x_n > /I}, 
@c @tex{K <x_1, \ldots, x_n > / I}. 
where @math{I} is a two-sided ideal. 
@math{A} is called @strong{standard finitely presented (s.f.p.)}, if there exists a monomial ordering,
such that @math{I} is given via its @strong{finite} Groebner basis @math{G}.

@subsection Monomial orderings on free algebras
@cindex Monomial orderings on free algebras

@c Leo's code
Monomial orderings are of critical importance when dealing with Groebner bases. 
Especially in the non-commutative Groebner theory up to a degree (length) bound it might be vital 
to have many choices for orderings since it is not guaranteed that there exists a finite Groebner 
bases with respect to the given ordering.


Let @math{X} = @{@math{x_1},@dots{},@math{x_n}@} be a set of symbols. A total ordering < on the free monoid @math{< X >} with @math{1} as the neutral element is called a @strong{monomial ordering} if 
@itemize
@item it is a well-ordering, i.e., every non empty subset has a least element with respect to <, and
@item it respects multiplication, that is @math{u < v} implies @math{aub < avb} for all @math{u}, @math{v}, @math{a} and @math{b} in @math{<X>}.
@end itemize
Note that the latter implies @math{1 <= m} for all @math{m} in @math{<X>}.

@c let , set ?
The @strong{left lexicographical ordering} on @math{<X>} with @math{x_1> x_2 > }@dots{}@math{ > x_n} is defined as follows: 
For arbitrary @math{a}, @math{b} in @math{<X>} we say that @math{a<b}, if 
@itemize
@item 
@tex
$\exists u\in \langle X\rangle\setminus\{1\}:\;au=b$ or
@end tex
@ifinfo
there exists @math{u} in < @math{X} > with @math{u} != @math{1\}, @math{au=b} or
@end ifinfo

@item 
@tex
$\exists u,\,v,\,w\in \langle X\rangle\;\exists x_i,\,x_j\in X: a=ux_iv,\;b=ux_jw$ and $i>j$ holds.
@end tex

@ifinfo
there exists @math{u}, @math{v}, @math{w} in @math{<X>} and there exists @math{x_i}, @math{x_j} in @math{X} such that @math{a=ux_i v}, @math{b=ux_j w} and @math{i>j} holds.
@end ifinfo

@end itemize

@strong{Note}: left lex is @strong{not} a monomial ordering, though it is a natural choice to break ties in further definitions. 

In a similar manner one can define the @strong{right lexicographical ordering}.

On the monoid 
@tex 
$(N_0,+)$
@end tex
@ifinfo
@math{(N_0,+)}
@end ifinfo
define the @strong{weight} homomorphism
@tex 
$w: \langle X\rangle\rightarrow N_0$
@end tex
@ifinfo
@math{w:<X>->N_0}
@end ifinfo 
, uniquely determined by @math{w(x_i)=w_i} in 
@tex
$N_0$
@end tex
@ifinfo
@math{N_0}
@end ifinfo
for @math{1 <= i <= n}. As a special case, define the @strong{length} 
@tex 
len:$ \langle X\rangle\rightarrow N_0$
@end tex
@ifinfo
@math{len:<X>->N_0}
@end ifinfo
 by @math{len(x_i)=1} for @math{1 <= i <= n}. For any ordering << on @math{<X>} and any weight 
@tex 
$w: \langle X\rangle\rightarrow N_0$
@end tex
@ifinfo
@math{w:<X>->N_0}
@end ifinfo 
 define an ordering <, the @math{w}-@strong{weight extension of} << as follows: For arbitrary @math{a}, @math{b} in @math{<X>} we say that @math{a<b} if 
@itemize
@item @math{w(a)<w(b)} or 
@item @math{w(a)=w(b)} and @math{a}<<@math{b} holds.
@end itemize
An ordering < on @math{<X>} @strong{eliminates} a certain subset 
@tex
$\emptyset\not=Y\subset X$ if for all $f\in K\langle X\rangle\setminus\{0\}$ one has $ lm(f)\in  K\langle X\setminus Y\rangle\Rightarrow f\in K\langle X\setminus Y\rangle\subseteq K\langle X\rangle$.
@end tex
@ifinfo
@{@}!=@math{Y}!=@math{X} of @math{X} if for all @math{f}!=@math{0} in @math{K<X>} the condition @math{lm(f)} in @math{K<X-Y>} implies @math{f} in @math{K<X-Y>}.
@end ifinfo

@c -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In a ring declaration, @sc{Letterplace} supports the following monomial orderings.

@subsection Groebner bases for two-sided ideals in free associative algebras
@cindex Groebner bases in free associative algebras

@c Hence the notions like a leading monomial and a leading coefficient transfer to this situation.

We say that a monomial @math{v} divides (two-sided or bilaterally) a monomial @math{w}, if there exist monomials
@tex
$p,s \in X$, such that $w = p \cdot v \cdot s$,
@end tex

@math{p,s} in @math{X}, such that @math{w = p} .  @math{v} .  @math{s},

For a subset $G \subset K\langle x_1,\dots,x_n \rangle =: T$,
define the \textbf{leading ideal} of $G$ to be the two-sided ideal
$LM(G) \; = \; {}_{T} \langle$ $\; \{lm(g) \;|\; g \in G\setminus\{0\} \}$ $\; \rangle_{T} \subseteq T$.

Let $<$ be a fixed monomial ordering on $T$.
We say that a subset $G \subset I$ is a \textbf{(two-sided) Groebner basis} for the ideal $I$ with respect to $<$, if $LM(G) = LM(I)$. That is $\forall f\in I\setminus\{0\}$ there exists $g\in G$, such that
$lm(g)$ divides $lm(f)$.

@math{LM(G)  =}  @{ @math{lm(g) | g} in @math{G}\@{0@} @} in @math{T}.

Let @math{<} be a fixed monomial ordering on @math{T}.
We say that a subset @math{G} of @math{I} is a @strong{(two-sided) Groebner basis} for the ideal @math{I} with respect to @math{<}, if @math{LM(G) = LM(I)}. That is for all @math{f} from @math{I}\@{0@} there exists @math{g} in @math{G}, such that @math{lm(g)} divides @math{lm(f)}.
@end ifinfo

Suppose, that the weights of the ring variables are strictly positive. 
We can interprete these weights as defining a nonstandard grading on the ring.
If the set of input polynomials is weighted homogeneous with respect to the given 
weights of the ring variables, then computing up to a weighted degree (and thus, also length) bound @math{d} 
results in the @strong{truncated Groebner basis} @math{G(d)}. In other words, by trimming elements
of degree exceeding @math{d} from the complete Groebner basis @math{G}, one obtains precisely @math{G(d)}.

In general, given a set @math{G(d)}, which is the result of Groebner basis computation 
up to weighted degree bound @math{d}, then 
it is the complete finite Groebner basis, if and only if @math{G(2d-1)=G(d)} holds.

The name letteplace has been inspired by the work of Rota and, independently, Feynman.

@tex
Already Feynman and Rota encoded
the monomials (words) of the free algebra
$x_{i_1} x_{i_2} \dots x_{i_m} \in K\langle x_1,\ldots,x_n \rangle$
via the double-indexed letterplace
(that is encoding the letter (= variable) and its place in the word) monomials
$x(i_1 | 1) x(i_2 | 2) \dots x(i_m | m) \in K[X\times N]$, where $X=\{x_1,\ldots,x_n\}$
and $N$ is the monoid of natural numbers, starting with 1 as the first possible place.
Note, that the letterplace algebra $K[X \times N]$ is an infinitely generated commutative polynomial $K$-algebra.
Since $K\langle x_1,\ldots,x_n \rangle$ is not Noetherian, it is common to perform the computations with 
its ideals and modules up to a given degree bound.

In [LL09] a natural shifting on letterplace polynomials was introduced and used.
Indeed, there is 1-to-1 correspondence between two-sided ideals
of a free algebra and so-called letterplace ideals in the letterplace algebra, 
see [LL09], [LL13], [LSS13] and [L14] for details.
Note, that first this correspondence was established for graded ideals.
All the computations take place in the letterplace algebra.

A letterplace monomial of length @math{m} is a monomial of a letterplace algebra, 
such that its @math{m} places are exactly 1,2,@dots{},@math{m}. 
In particular, such monomials are multilinear with respect to places (i.e. 
no place, smaller than the length is omitted or filled more than with one letter).
A letterplace polynomial is an element of the @math{K}-vector space, 
spanned by letterplace monomials. A letterplace ideal is generated by letterplace 
polynomials subject to two kind of operations:

$K$-algebra operations of the letterplace algebra \textbf{and} simultaneous shifting of places by any natural number $n$.

@subsection Examples of use of @sc{Letterplace}

First, define a commutative ring @math{K[X]} in @sc{Singular}, equipped with a monomial well-ordering
and call it, say, @code{r}. 
Then, decide what should be the degree (length) bound @math{d} and run the procedure @code{freeAlgebra(r, d)}.
This procedure creates a commutative Letterplace ring with an ordering, 
corresponding to the one in the original commutative ring @math{K[X]}, see @ref{Monomial orderings on free algebras}.

In this @math{K}-algebra, define an ideal @code{I} as a list of polynomials in the
free algebra (@code{x*y} and @code{y*x} are different) and run @code{twostd}. The answer is a two-sided Groebner bases of
the two-sided ideal @math{I}.

We illustrate the approach with the following example:

@smallexample
@c example
LIB "freegb.lib";
ring r = 0,(x,y,z),dp;
def R = freeAlgebra(r, 4);  // degree (length) bound 4; the ordering will be degree right lex
setring R;
ideal I = x*y + y*z, x*x + x*y - z;
ideal J = twostd(I);
J;
@c example
@end smallexample

There are various conversion routines in the library @code{freegb_lib} (see @ref{freegb_lib}).
Many algebras are predefined in the library @code{fpalgebras_lib} (see @ref{fpalgebras_lib}).
Important ring-theoretic properties can be established with the help of the library @code{fpaprops_lib} (see @ref{fpaprops_lib}),
while K-dimension and monomial bases and Hilbert data - with the help of the library @code{fpadim_lib} (see @ref{fpadim_lib}).
We work further on implementing more algorithms for non-commutative ideals and modules over free associative algebra.

@subsection Functionality and release notes of @sc{Letterplace}

With the present functionality it is possible to compute two-sided Groebner basis
of an arbitrary two-sided ideal in a free associative algebra up to a given degree. 
The weights of variables are determined by the current monomial ordering.

Restrictions/conventions of the @sc{Letterplace} subsystem:
@itemize
@item Since free algebra is not Noetherian, one has to define an explicit degree (length) bound,
up to which a partial Groebner basis will be computed. Note, that @code{freeAlgebra} call stores the bound 
in the structure of the ring it creates. Thus running @code{twostd} or @code{std} in such a
ring does not require the degree bound in its argument.
@item The options @code{redSB, redTail} are effective for Groebner basis computations,
@item The options @code{prot, mem} are effective for the whole @sc{Letterplace} subsystem. 
@end itemize

Operations for polynomials in Letterplace rings are @code{+} (addition),
@code{-} (subtraction), @code{*} (multiplication) and @code{^} (power).

Functions for objects from Letterplace rings are: @ref{twostd}, @ref{std}, @ref{maxideal}, @ref{reduce}.

Further functionality is provided in the libraries for the @sc{Letterpace} subsystem.

In the @ref{freegb_lib} one finds e.g. Letterplace arithmetics procedures, conversion tools,
procedures for creating some common ideals of relations as well as the normal form
procedure, providing effective ideal membership test.

The @ref{fpadim_lib} contains procedures for computations with vector space basis
of a factor algebra including finiteness check and dimension computation.

The @ref{fpaprops_lib} contains procedures for determining important ring-theoretic properties 
including Gelfand-Kirillov dimension.

The @ref{fpalgebras_lib} contains procedures for the generation of various algebras, including group algebras of finitely presented groups in the Letterplace ring.

The @ref{ncfactor_lib} contains the procedure @code{ncfactor} for factorizing polynomials in the Letterplace ring.

@sc{Letterplace} has undergone several stages of development. 

The first one, the pure Letterplace implementation for homogeneous
ideals, was created by V. Levandovskyy and H. Schoenemann in 2007-2009. 

Later in 2010-2014, experiments with advanced
(among other, with shift-invariant) data structures were performed by
V. Levandovskyy, B. Schnitzler and G. Studzinski, and new libraries 
for @math{K}-dimension, @math{K}-bases, and Ufnarovskij graph were written.

The next stage started in 2017, when K. Abou Zeid joined the team of 
H. Schoenemann and V. Levandovskyy. Those recent activities led to the change 
of interface to the one, usual in the free algebra. The Letterplace data structure
is still at heart of the implementation, though not explicitly visible by default.

This chapter gives a complete reference of all functions and commands of the @sc{Letterplace} kernel, i.e. all built-in commands
(for the numerous @sc{Letterplace} libraries see @ref{LETTERPLACE libraries}).

The general syntax of a function is
@format
                   [target =] function_name (<arguments>);
@end format


Note, that both @strong{Control structures} and @strong{System variables} of
@sc{Letterplace} are the same as of @sc{Singular} (see @ref{Control structures}, @ref{System variables}).

@item @strong{Type:}
the type of the first argument
@item @strong{Purpose:}
reduces a polynomial, vector, or ideal to its @strong{two-sided} normal form with
respect to an ideal represented by a two-sided Groebner basis, if the second argument is such a basis.
@*returns 0 if and only if the polynomial (resp.@: vector, ideal)
is an element (resp.@: subideal) of the ideal.
@*Otherwise, the result may have no meaning.
@*The third (optional) argument 1 of type int forces a reduction which considers only the leading term and does no tail reduction.
@item @strong{Note:}
The commands @code{reduce} and @code{NF} are synonymous.
@item @strong{Example:}

@c example
ring r = 0,(x,y),dp;
def R = freeAlgebra(r,5); setring R;
ideal I = x*x + y*y - 1; // 2D sphere
ideal J = twostd(I); // computes a two-sided Groebner basis
J; // it is finite and nice
poly g = x*y*y - y*y*x;
reduce(g,J); // hence g belongs to J
poly h = x*y*y*x - y*x*x;
reduce(h,J); // the rest of two-sided division of h by J
