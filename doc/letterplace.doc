@subsection Free associative algebras
@cindex free associative algebra, tensor algebra

Let @math{V} be a @math{K}-vector space, spanned by the symbols @math{x_1},@dots{},@math{x_n}.
A free associative algebra in @math{x_1},@dots{},@math{x_n} over @math{K}, denoted by @math{K}< @math{x_1},@dots{},@math{x_n} >
is also known as a tensor algebra @math{T(V)} of @math{V}. It is an infinite dimensional @math{K}-vector space, where one can take
as a basis the elements of the free monoid < @math{x_1},@dots{},@math{x_n} >, identifying the identity element (the empty word) with the @math{1} in @math{K}. In other
words, the monomials of @math{K} < @math{x_1},@dots{},@math{x_n} > are the words
of finite length in the finite alphabet @{ @math{x_1},@dots{},@math{x_n} @}. The algebra @math{K}< @math{x_1},@dots{},@math{x_n} > is an
integral domain, which is not Noetherian for @math{n>1} (hence, a two-sided Groebner basis of a finitely generated ideal might be infinite). The free associative algebra can be regarded as a graded algebra in a natural way.

Any finitely presented associative algebra is isomorphic to a
quotient of @math{K}< @math{x_1},@dots{},@math{x_n} > modulo a two-sided ideal.

@tex
We call a total ordering $<$ on the free monoid $X := \langle x_1,\dots,x_n \rangle$ (where $1$ is identified with the identity element) a
\textbf{monomial ordering} if the following conditions hold:

Hence the notions like a leading monomial and a leading coefficient transfer to this situation.
@c as they usually do

We say that a monomial @math{v} divides monomial @math{w}, if there exist monomials
@tex
$p,s \in X$, such that $w = p \cdot v \cdot s$.
@end tex

@ifinfo
@math{p,s} in @math{X}, such that @math{w = p} .  @math{v} .  @math{s} .
@end ifinfo

In other words @math{v} is a proper subword of @math{w}.

@tex
For a subset $G \subset T := K\langle x_1,\dots,x_n \rangle$,

Let $<$ be a fixed monomial ordering on $T$.
We say that a subset $G \subset I$ is a \textbf{(two-sided) Groebner basis} for the ideal $I$ with respect to $<$, if $L(G) = L(I)$. That is $\forall f\in I\setminus\{0\}$ there exists $g\in G$, such that

@subsection Letterplace correspondence
@cindex letterplace correspondence

The name letteplace has been inspired by the work of Rota and, independently, Feynman.

@tex
Already Feynman and Rota encoded
the monomials (words) of the free algebra
$x_{i_1} x_{i_2} \dots x_{i_m} \in K\langle x_1,\ldots,x_n \rangle$
via the double-indexed letterplace
(that is encoding the letter (= variable) and its place in the word) monomials
$x(i_1 | 1) x(i_2 | 2) \dots x(i_m | m) \in K[X\times N]$, where $X=\{x_1,\ldots,x_n\}$
and $N$ is the monoid of natural numbers, starting with 0 which cannot be used as a place.
@end tex
@ifinfo
Already Feynman and Rota encoded
the monomials (words) of the free algebra
@math{x_(i_1) x_(i_2)} @dots{} @math{x_(i_m)} in @math{K< x_1},@dots{},@math{x_n >}
via the double-indexed letterplace
(that is encoding the letter (= variable) and its place in the word) monomials
@math{x(i_1 | 1) x(i_2 | 2)} @dots{} @math{x(i_m | m)} in @math{K[X x N]}, where @math{X=} @{ @math{x_1},@dots{},@math{x_n} @}
and @math{N} is the monoid of natural numbers, starting with 0 which cannot be used as a place.
@end ifinfo



Note, that the letterplace algebra @math{K[X \times N]} is an infinitely generated commutative polynomial @math{K}-algebra.
Since @math{K<} @math{x_1},@dots{},@math{x_n} @math{>} is not Noetherian, it is common to perform the computations with modules up to a given degree.
In that case the truncated letterplace algebra is finitely generated commutative ring.

In [LL09] a natural shifting on letterplace polynomials was introduced and used.
Indeed, there is 1-to-1 correspondence between two-sided ideals
of a free algebra and so-called letterplace ideals in the letterplace algebra, see [LL09], [LL13], [LSS13] and [L14] for details.
Note, that first this correspondence was established for graded ideals.
All the computations take place in the letterplace algebra.

A letterplace monomial of length @math{m} is a monomial of a letterplace algebra, such that its @math{m} places are exactly 1,2,@dots{},@math{m}. In particular, such monomials are multilinear with respect to places. A letterplace polynomial is an element of the @math{K}-vector space, spanned by letterplace monomials. A letterplace ideal is generated by letterplace polynomials subject to two kind of operations:

the
@tex
$K$-algebra operations of the letterplace algebra and simultaneous shifting of places by any natural number $n$.

@ifinfo
@math{K}-algebra operations of the letterplace algebra and simultaneous shifting of places by any natural number @math{n}.

@node Example of use of Letterplace, Release notes, Letterplace correspondence,LETTERPLACE
@subsection Example of use of @sc{Letterplace}

The input monomials must be given in a letterplace notation (though we recommend to
get used to the letterplace notation, the procedure @code{freeGBasis } from the @ref{freegb_lib}
provides an alternative).

We recommend first to define a commutative ring @math{K[X]} in @sc{Singular} and equip it with
a degree well-ordering. Then, decide what should be the degree bound d and
run the procedure @code{makeLetterplaceRing(d)}
@c @code{freegbRing(d)}
from the library @ref{freegb_lib}.
This procedure creates a letterplace algebra with an ordering, induced from the given commutative ring @math{K[X]}.
In this algebra, define an ideal @code{I} as a list of polynomials in the letterplace encoding
and run @code{std}.

It is possible to convert the letterplace presentation of an ideal to a list of strings with the help of procedures @code{lp2lstr} and @code{lst2str} from the library @ref{freegb_lib}. This is shown in the second part of the example below.

Yet another anternative is to use the procedure @code{freeGBasis} from @ref{freegb_lib} in order to use a different encoding for polynomials in free algebra. No conversion tools are needed in that case.

We illustrate the approach with the following example:

@smallexample
@c example
LIB "freegb.lib";
ring r = 0,(x,y,z),dp;
def R = makeLetterplaceRing(4);  // with degree bound 4
setring R;
ideal I = x*y + y*z, x*x + x*y - y*x - y*y;
ideal J = std(I);
J;
@c example
@end smallexample

There are various conversion routines in the library @code{freegb_lib} (see @ref{freegb_lib}).
We work further on implementing more algorithms for non-commutative ideals and modules over free associative algebra.

@subsection Release notes of @sc{Letterplace}

With this functionality it is possible to compute two-sided Groebner basis
of a graded two-sided ideal (that is, an ideal, generated by homogeneous polynomials)
in a free associative algebra up to a given degree. It is assumed, that each variable
has degree 1.

Restrictions of the @sc{Letterplace} package:
@itemize
@item At the moment we provide stable implementation for the homogeneous input only,
computations with quasi-homogeneous and general inhomogeneous ideals are under development. (There are no automatic checks.)
@item Since free algebra is not Noetherian, one has to define an explicit degree bound,
up to which a partial Groebner basis will be computed. Note, that @code{makeLetterplaceRing} procedure
stores the bound in the structure of the ring it creates. Thus running @code{std} in such a
ring does not require the degree bound in its argument.
@item the options @code{option(redSB); option(redTail);} must be always activated
@item we advise to run the computations with the options  @code{option(prot);option(mem);}
in order to see the activity journal as well as the memory usage
@end itemize

Operations for polynomials in letterplace rings are @code{+} (addition),
@code{-} (subtraction), @code{*} (multiplication) and @code{^} (power).

Functions for objects from letterplace rings are: @ref{std}, @ref{maxideal}.

Further functionality is provided in the libraries for the @sc{Letterpace} subsystem.

In the @ref{freegb_lib} one finds e.g. letterplace arithmetics procedures, conversion tools,
procedures for creating some common ideals of relations as well as the normal form
procedure, providing effective ideal membership test.


The @ref{fpadim_lib} contains procedures for computations with vector space basis
of a factor algebra including finiteness check and dimension computation.

The @ref{fpalgebras_lib} contains procedures for the generation of various algebras, including group algebras of finitely presented groups in the Letterplace ring.
