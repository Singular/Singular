-------------------------------------------------------------
History of the "surfex" algebraic geometry visualization tool
-------------------------------------------------------------

If you experience any bug which is not listed here, 
or if you would want us to add another feature, 
please, feel free to contact us via our website:
www.surfex.AlgebraicSurface.net

Below the bugs and features you will find a list of changes
which occured in the version which appeared up to now.


known bugs:
-----------

- HC: does not work if blanks occur in path names or file names
- NT: when using files in only two variables the program sometimes hangs up
- NT: when trying to close the last project, surfex hangs up (so: disabled)


feature requests: 
-----------------

- OL: good end user documentation
- OL: good internal documentation
- NT: make a clear licence statement
- HC: mpeg-export
- HC: check-box in save movie allowing to omit the first/last frame or not
- OL: allow other clipping then sphere-clipping
- HC: produce mpeg-movies
- OL: save surfex-command-line which would have to be used for producing 
      the raytraced image / movie
- OL: run surfex as a "compute-" or "display-server" for other tools
- OL: plane curves

- OL: combine multiple images/movies into a single one
- OL: use a config file to store configurations, such as browser, tempdir, etc.
- OL: save backups of all open projects regularly
- OL: open several projects at the same time
- OL: when quitting, check if all projects saved
- OL: complete light source positioning
- OL: allow to remove parameters/equations/curves/points
- OL: allow cutting with (several) arbitrary surfaces 
- OL: allow boolean operations (this requires either to use PovRay or to implement
  this feature in surf!)
- OL: API to allow other tools to access surfex's features 
      (e.g. for use from Cinderella)
- OL: internally seperate computational part from windows
      (e.g., this makes surfex a lot faster when used as a command line
      script)
- OL: use some triangulation tool to compute triangulations of the surfaces /
  curves
- OL: allow building real-world models using the triangulation combined with
  additional features such as: boolean operations / offset on triangulations
- OL: make internal check for changes in a project more efficient


0.89.05
-------
November 2006

new features / repaired bugs:

- OL: windows install improved - should now find surf.exe and convert.exe on
      most systems quickly
- OL: free scaling added (user can give bounds for the scaling slider)
- OL: clear project menu item added
- OL: load project menu item added (was disabled because of a bug)
- bug repaired (OL): HC: parameters always start at 0.0 when used in movies
- OL: filename shown on top of the tab
- OL: several minor bugs repaired

0.89.04
-------
September 2006

new features / repaired bugs:

- OL: save dialogues are now really save dialogues (not open dialogues as before)
- OL: now remembers the directory which was used to open/save a file/movie
- OL: some bugs corrected
- OL: disabled the features which had bugs and which where not so important
