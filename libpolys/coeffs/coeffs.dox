/*! \page libpolys_coeffs_page Coefficients for Singular rings and algebras
 *
 * Here we implement number arithmetic for some rings/fields (coeff. or number domains): \ref coeffs (Q, ZZ, etc?)
 * 
 * Generic number is just a void * (\ref number). 
 * Coefficient domains are to be defined by specifying a set of function pointers 
 * in form of a structure: (\ref coeffs).
