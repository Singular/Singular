* ABSTRACT: numbers in a rational function field K(t_1, .., t_s) with
*           transcendental variables t_1, ..., t_s, where s >= 1.
*           Denoting the implemented coeffs object by cf, then these numbers
*           are represented as quotients of polynomials living in the
*           polynomial ring K[t_1, .., t_s] represented by cf->extring.
*
*           An element of K(t_1, .., t_s) may have numerous representations,
*           due to the possibility of common polynomial factors in the
*           numerator and denominator. This problem is handled by a
*           cancellation heuristic: Each number "knows" its complexity
*           which is 0 if and only if common factors have definitely been
*           cancelled, and some positive integer otherwise.
*           Each arithmetic operation of two numbers with complexities c1
*           and c2 will result in a number of complexity c1 + c2 + some
*           penalty (specific for each arithmetic operation; see constants
*           in the *.h file). Whenever the resulting complexity exceeds a
*           certain threshold (see constant in the *.h file), then the
*           cancellation heuristic will call 'factory' to compute the gcd
*           and cancel it out in the given number. (This definite cancel-
*           lation will also be performed at the beginning of ntWrite,
*           ensuring that any output is free of common factors.
*           For the special case of K = Q (i.e., when computing over the
*           rationals), this definite cancellation procedure will also take
*           care of nested fractions: If there are fractional coefficients
*           in the numerator or denominator of a number, then this number
*           is being replaced by a quotient of two polynomials over Z, or
*           - if the denominator is a constant - by a polynomial over Q.

/** a number in K(t_1, .., t_s) is represented by either NULL
   (representing the zero number), or a pointer to a fraction which contains
   the numerator polynomial and the denominator polynomial in K[t_1, .., t_s];
   if the denominator is 1, the member 'denominator' is NULL;
   as a consequence of the above we get: if some number n is not NULL, then
   n->numerator cannot be NULL;
   The member 'complexity' attempts to capture the complexity of any given
   number n, i.e., starting with a bunch of numbers n_i that have their gcd's
   cancelled out, n may be constructed from the n_i's by using field
   arithmetics (+, -, *, /). If we never cancel out gcd's during this process,
   n will become rather complex. The larger the attribute 'complexity' of n
   is, the more likely it is that n contains some non-trivial gcd. Thus, this
   attribute will be used by a heuristic method to cancel out gcd's from time
   to time. (This heuristic may be set up such that cancellation can be
   enforced after each arithmetic operation, or such that it will never take
   place.) Moreover, the 'complexity' of n is zero iff the gcd in n (that is,
     the gcd of its numerator and denominator) is trivial.
