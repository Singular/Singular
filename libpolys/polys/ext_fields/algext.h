* ABSTRACT: numbers in an algebraic extension field K[a] / < f(a) >
*           Assuming that we have a coeffs object cf, then these numbers
*           are polynomials in the polynomial ring K[a] represented by
*           cf->extRing.
*           IMPORTANT ASSUMPTIONS:
*           1.) So far we assume that cf->extRing is a valid polynomial
*               ring in exactly one variable, i.e., K[a], where K is allowed
*               to be any field (representable in SINGULAR and which may
*               itself be some extension field, thus allowing for extension
*               towers).
*           2.) Moreover, this implementation assumes that
*               cf->extRing->minideal is not NULL but an ideal with at
*               least one non-zero generator which may be accessed by
*               cf->extRing->minideal->m[0] and which represents the minimal
*               polynomial f(a) of the extension variable 'a' in K[a].
*           3.) As soon as an std method for polynomial rings becomes
*               availabe, all reduction steps modulo f(a) should be replaced
*               by a call to std. Moreover, in this situation one can finally
*               move from K[a] / < f(a) > to
*                  K[a_1, ..., a_s] / I, with I some zero-dimensional ideal
*                                        in K[a_1, ..., a_s] given by a lex
*                                        Gr√∂bner basis.
*               The code in algext.h and algext.cc is then capable of
*               computing in K[a_1, ..., a_s] / I.
